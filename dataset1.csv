99% of servers are Russian (wtf!!!) and the rest are banning my access - I don't know why and I don't care, I just get kicked and banned after 20 seconds.

So my experience with this game is awful and I'm not interested in researching why, I payed for the game and get almost zero results. Oh and those 5 hours of play time were made in a couple days on random servers full of cheaters (I remember this game had a cheat protection or something?) and horrible players with disgusting chat messages. Will surely uninstall and forget about it...",Negative
10,"As much of a classic as this one is, I have to say that it genuinely wasn't all that enjoyable.
Just because a game is old and nostalgic doesn't outright prove the quality of it. This is the case for Counter-Strike.
CS was first a modification for Half-Life and soon turned into a Valve game. Soon, it turned into one of the most popular shooters in history.
However, during my walkthrough and gameplay of the game, I noticed that the game didn't have a very active playerbase. That's alright, every once in a while you can find people playing still.
However, the moment that I try to make a server for myself, I realize that bots are non-existant to add in your own, private server. There is definitely a way, but I just didn't have time to get it to work. Counter Strike: Source has this feature available at all times.
Presented with the same boring menu that almost every single Goldsrc game has (Half-Life, Day of Defeat, any other CS game before CSS, etc.), I couldn't customize the crosshair the way I wanted to.
I also want to mention how the in-game HUD felt like garbage. It was extremely bare-bones.

But overall, it's Counter-Strike. It's the first entry, give it a break. Since then, VALVe has been able to improve the franchise over time. I personally wouldn't recommend it because of how bare-bones it is. 
But if you like Counter-Strike, try Counter-Strike: Source.",Negative

10,"I think the nostalgia of this game is beautiful but I would have to say that this game is honestly not worth it because of all of the people who are either pros or cheaters consequently the game is unplayable. Admittedly, I am a noob but irrespective of what server I connect to there is pretty much no chance I can have any fun. Sometimes it really feels like they have to be using some kind of aimbot or something, the'res just no way they aren't cheating. Maybe to give them the benefit of the doubt you could say they have been playing this game for the better part of 20 years. Even still the servers are all over saturated with such players who just don't let amateur players like me have any chance. Which is surely a real shame if we can't experience a masterpiece like this without having our experience completely ruined. I don't mind losing but it is really frustrating when you get killed every time you peek a corner or try to attack the enemy nevermind how careful you are, how well armoured you are... regardless you will get killed in a fraction of a second. What kind of bullshit is that? I'm going to try CS source to see if it is any better.

With this game, the only fun you can have is to connect to an empty server that has bots. But that of course gets really boring quite fast.",Negative

10,"Honestly, a very classic game. However, there is one extreme downside to it: there's no bots. That's right, a Counter-Strike game with no bots. What is this?!?!

Without any bots to play against, you can really only play against players, and that's nearly impossible at this point due to how old this game is and the little community that it has.
This game doesn't get many players, meaning it's almost impossible to actually play it unless you stay in a multiplayer server by yourself for hours and hours until someone actually joins.

If the developers add bots, I'll replay the game and edit my review accordingly. I do recommend this game, but my experience has just not been positive, due to the fact that there's nobody to play this game with, making this game basically turn into a ""walk around and shoot stuff and do nothing else"" simulator.

[h3] Pros: [/h3] [b]üî´ Classic Tactical Gameplay[/b] Counter-Strike offers timeless tactical gameplay that has captivated players for decades. With its focus on team-based combat, strategic planning, and precise gunplay, the game provides a challenging and rewarding experience for veterans and newcomers alike. üí£üéÆ

[b]üåê Large Player Community[/b] The game boasts a large and active player community, ensuring vibrant multiplayer matches and a variety of game modes to enjoy.

[h3] Cons: [/h3] [b]üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è High Skill Ceiling[/b] Counter-Strike has a steep learning curve, requiring players to develop advanced skills in aiming, movement, and game sense to succeed. Newcomers may find themselves overwhelmed by experienced players, leading to frustration and discouragement. üìàü§î

[b]üé® Dated Graphics and Visuals[/b] Despite its enduring gameplay, Counter-Strike's graphics and visual design may feel dated compared to modern titles. While gameplay mechanics remain solid, some players may be deterred by the game's lack of visual polish and immersion. üñºÔ∏èüëé

[h3] Other Downsides: [/h3] [b]üéµ Limited Audio Immersion[/b] The game's audio design, while functional, may not provide the same level of immersion found in more recent shooters. Players may find the sound effects and soundtrack lacking in depth and variety, detracting from the overall experience. üé∂üîá

[b]üéÆ High Skill Gap Between Players[/b] Counter-Strike's competitive nature can lead to significant skill disparities between players, resulting in one-sided matches and frustration for those on the losing end. Balancing teams based on skill level could improve the overall enjoyment for all players. ‚öñÔ∏èü§∫

10,"Glad I caught your attention.

The original CS is still a fun game, totally worth playing. But if you're looking for an authentic server experience, sad to say is hard to find one, especially with most of the community servers in the game that's mostly hosted by Russians, and some Asian servers, that could sometimes put your PC at risk 

If you could spare a few bucks, buy it for your friends too, try setting up your own servers together with your own DIscord community and maybe setup LAN play with your friends, that is if they brought a laptop or just hit the internet cafe in your area (if there's one available). Plus, with the full package it includes Condition Zero for those who are interested to try out. For solo play, the OG CS doesn't have one since they removed it years ago, but CZ does have offline bots if you're interested at playing solo.",Negative

My favourite game is Counter Strike: Global Offensive. I have so many hours on it (almost too many) and I thought about trying the game that started it all, aside from Half-Life, since it was on sale for a few bucks. It was terrible.

So, what do I think? I know the game is almost 22 years old as of writing this, so I will give it the benefit of the doubt. I'm sure Valve doesn't care one bit about keeping the community alive for this game, but it is almost unplayable. Sure, there is some nostalgia for those that played it back in the day, but you are way better off just playing CS:GO nowadays if you enjoy a stable game. 

There aren't any bugs or anything as Valve has always been pretty consistent with keeping a game in good shape, but the gameplay is pretty subpar for 2000. I know Counter Strike was just coming on to the scene that Call of Duty would soon overtake, but it plays like Doom from the 90's in my opinion. But, hackers are what ruin the game. It is downright unplayable because of how bad the aimbotting, flying, wallhacking, insta-killing, and many more hacks have gotten. If you load into a game, you will not get a single kill.

Even if this game becomes free at any point, do not get it. It will just waste your storage space that could be used for playable games. But props to Valve for evolving from this mess into the CS:GO we love today. <3

First of all: FRUTA QUE PARIU.

 Yesterday (March 15th) was my birthday and my friend gave me the classic CS as a birthday present.

Little did i Know that this was a Trojan Horse (no. not the virus. the REAL trojan horse)

while in-game, my PC started to get blue dots on the screen and suddenly reset. 
after the sudden reboot, it started to get a black screen and that was it.

i've restarted it over 10 times and realized i had to use safe mode to turn it on and delete this SHITTY GAME FILE so it could turn on again normally. 

Please, if you love your family; do NOT, absolutely, do NOT GIVE THEM THIS GIFT! 
AND DO NOT BUY THIS OLD GAME. buy CS GO instead.

this is a harmful piece of software. [h1] You want to disable a bomb? fine. do it in videogames. not in real life by letting your PC to run this piece of crap. [/h1]",Negative

10,"Here you will see why I love Counter-Strike, but in my review you will read about why I gave it a negative review due to some problems.

I love Counter-Strike I love the feel of Counter-Strike's guns more than Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.

Now I remember back in 2005 when I first played Counter-Strike it had DirectX 8 support and now with VALVe pushing Linux support and removing DirectX 8 from the Gold Source engine video games adding OpenGL support to the Gold Source engine video games I keep getting OpenGL errors every now and then and some freezing issues, which I do not remember ever happening with DirectX 8.

Here is a screenshot of one of the few OpenGL errors I experience here and there. Followed by freezing of the video games that use OpenGL, before crashing.

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/887417416764768257/926930307003850792/OpenGL_errors_on_video_games_that_use_OpenGL_on_Windows.png

VALVe please add DirectX 8 support or at least a more up to date version of DirectX 9 support which supports 64-bit, which is DirectX 9.0C I believe?

Otherwise I cannot give Counter-Strike a positive review due to these technical issues, which I cannot seem to fix even if I reinstall Windows or Counter-Strike.

Also VALVe please release Counter-Strike with Counter-Strike Condition Zero, Counter-Strike: Source included for sale on gog.com. You have said with the Source 2 engine that video game developers developing video games on the Source 2 engine can release the video games that they develop for sale on gog.com please.",Negative
10,"it really sucks and i mean it just sucks why is this?

for 1 a lot of servers are just trash to me that is rockets jetpacks its not fair zombies cant fly
and with the admins abusing there powers for one i remember i took of a admins armor
i infected him i left him and i realized he gonna use the antidot i come back around i smack him in the back of his head saying no bad admin don't do that
he gets a rage boner and bans me right there because he sucked so hard on my 20inches of fat fairy cock

but is there more?
yes

for 2 i had a admin block me with a remote car when i was the boss zombie and i could not do any thing but leave i did that i come back then get banned it was not fair and i was targeted i seen no one else get that lovely treatment but me

and for 3rd this game is not how it used to be there some servers with two players being jerks and just team up on you as the zombie its not fun this game is pretty dead but still gets a good almost 300 amount of players each day that i see to me i see it under 100 players

there was a server i really enjoyed when i was a little cub it was ROZ RISE OF ZOMBIES
to me great admin not abusive with there powers great maps they had lots of secret rooms i could find lots of good times even the ZE maps were fun
but sadly its not steam you got to go on a unknown site and download it and connect to the server and thats a big shame
one of the best servers i have ever played

remember CS WARZONE that what i downloaded back then and well it got deleted it was a big shame
i remember the first ever ZM map i went on idk the name but it was a sewer with a out side and 3 rooms out side leading into one room then a hallway leading into a sewer area and there was a place players can go up to on the sides of the wall and a secret in the water and there was another room near the room near the outside on the side small hallway leading to another room


if you asked me don't buy this game its up to you but you might not get the same treatment i got who knows
regardless some ZE servers need a password idk why and lots are not in english
it is sad that i cant play that server any more
but from my times playing i still remember a lot of the hidden rooms and secrets in so many maps that i played on
i was always the one hiding being the last one to survive till the clock hits 0


its funny i remember some guy glitched me with sand bags i was like WTF dude then out of nowhere
i glitched again behind the sand bags and behind the player XD then they broke threw killed him i was backing my fat ass up shooting and i was the last one to survive
that is also why i love glitches it was so funny best karma that i have ever seen in my life",Negative

10,"A masterpiece. Not only amazing for its time, but I'm having a blast still playing it today.

The strongest point of this game is the engine - essentially the Half Life engine. Even to this day, no other engine that I've seen has managed to capture the intricate movement mechanics that CS 1.6 provides. The strafe-jumping, long-jumping, endless bunny-hopping, and the thousands of custom-made maps and addons there are give the player the utmost freedom to explore the CS 1.6 world and exploit the engine to its fullest potential.

The move to the source was a downgrade. It comes nowhere close to feeling as smooth and responsive as the Half Life engine.

Even though most of the servers are empty now, I still have a few that I frequent, with a healthy amount of players. And with the help of a few mods, LAN can provide just as much content.

Maybe it's not for everyone, especially for those that have become accustomed to the newest flashy Fortnite clone. But for me, the game deserves nothing less than a thumbs up.

10,"While not a bad game, Counter-strike 1.6 certainly did not age nearly as well as Source did. The FOV scaling that GoldSrc uses makes this game very difficult to play on a modern display, and from what I can tell there aren't really a whole lot of pure vanilla CS servers, unlike what Global Offensive has thanks to matchmaking. CS 1.6 is prettymuch only there for the mods at this point, in a similar way to CS Source, but with the added disadvantage that the outdated engine is not only less compatible with modern systems but also is less capable over all for custom gamemodes. Source is a lot better for custom maps and modes, as the engine limitations are far less strict and allow for much more creative tools. Source also has real physics, instead of the fake ones that were carried over from Half-Life (and technically Quake as well since they were used for dead body physics before ragdolls were a thing). This means better bhop and surf, alongside other custom gamemodes that take advantage of the Havok physics engine. Counter Strike Source also includes assets essential for certain Garry's Mod content to work properly, which alone in itself makes it more important than 1.6.

In conclusion, 1.6 is rendered completely obsolete by both Source and Global Offensive. Your only reason to purchase 1.6 is if you have friends who you really want to play it with, or if you are making/playing custom maps or mods made exclusively for it that were never ported to Source. From what I understand, 1.6 did have some other differences in gameplay mechanics that many veterans prefer over Global Offensive, but as a competitive shooter Global Offensive is more polished and more comfortable, especially now with the crosshair customization. If you want community mods, get CS Source or Garry's Mod. A lot of Source community gamemodes have even been ported to Global Offensive, so if you don't have money, you can play those for free.",Negative

10,"""Having experienced both CSGO and Counter Strike 1.6, I must say that aiming at opponents in Counter Strike 1.6 can be quite a formidable task. The mechanics and precision required to land those crucial shots take time to master. However, it's worth noting that the game has garnered a reputation for its toxic fanbase. It's not uncommon to encounter players who are quick to kick you if they perceive your skills to be lacking.

For newcomers seeking a space to practice and improve their gameplay, Counter Strike 1.6 might not be the most welcoming environment. The competitive nature of the game combined with the presence of experienced players can make it challenging for beginners to find their footing without facing criticism or even outright bullying.

Despite these aspects, Counter Strike 1.6 still holds a certain charm. Its nostalgic graphics and gameplay continue to attract a dedicated community of players who appreciate its classic appeal.

10,"DON'T BOTHER WITH THIS OR CONDITION ZERO AS THEY ARE NOT SUPPORTED AND WILL NOT EVEN OPEN!
I bought this as part of Counter Strike Complete as I wanted to play CS Condition Zero (Complete includes CS, CS Condition Zero and CS Source).
Both CS and CS CZ will not even open and run after lots of searching and trying to report a fault it became evident that STEAM DO NOT SUPPORT CS OR CS CZ.
I played CS Source on the day of purchase for a several hours which seems to play without any problems for me on Linux Steam.
Tried on the following day to get vanilla CS and CS CZ running to no avail and unable to get support from Steam, after searching online it became evident that nobody is supporting vanilla CS or CS CZ.
This begs the question why steam are selling a product which doesn't work and that they offer no support for (and neither does anyone else).
To make matters worse, when I requested a refund less than 24 after purchasing the CS Complete pack I received and email stating that as I played the purchase for more than 2 hours that my request for a refund was refused (well in fairness I had played a third of it for more than 2 hours as two thirds of the pack does not work at all).
If CS and CS CZ doesn't work then for pity sake steam, STOP SELLING IT - THIS MAKES YOU LOOK QUESTIONABLE TO SAY THE LEAST.
MY ADVICE IS BY ALL MEANS BUY CS SOURCE IF THAT IS YOUR THING BUT TO STAY WELL AWAY FROM ANY CS PACK WHICH CONTAINS NON SOURCE ELEMENTS.",Negative

10,"Do you want to experience an old but classical game? Will this be the first time playing CS 1.6? Are you looking forward to NOT join a community of angry Russian players? If your answer is yes to all of these questions, then nope, go and buy another game, ANY other game will do, because you will grow to hate CS 1.6. 

Oh, not because it's a bad game per say, but you will play against people with about 15-20 years of experience, meaning you will die, die and of course die. Sure you can push on through for some months to get those skills as this game is very dexterity orientated, but the question is, will it be worth it? 

Well, only you can decide if you are masochistic enough, and no. Playing against badly programmed bots will only give you so much enjoyment before it gets dull. Furthermore it will NOT give you enough experience to stand your ground against real players once you have built up your confidence.

However, If this ISN'T your first time playing CS 1.6 then what are you waiting for? Buy it right now because it is just as fun as you remember it!!! But I don't have to tell you this, do I?

TL:DR An old school skill based shooter with an EXTRMELY unfriendly learning curve inside a very cancerous community. However, if you find this review triggering, then this is your kind of game and you should go and own some noobs, because this game is gold.~",Negative

Oh also all of the servers are Brazilian or something and will run scripts to make you join other servers and unbind all of your inputs.",Negative
10,very laggy and the bots are using aimbot leggit,Negative
10,"This game was much better before Steam, hosted on the WON or World Opponent Network.
Now there is too much lag, the servers have poor hit reg, many players use cheats.
The servers are too big in size, anything over 16 player for public is too many and defeats the strategy of each map.
All the steam interface adds too much latency and ruins the experience.
UK doesn't host any servers, having to connect to far away servers adds latency which makes the game unplayable.
Bots have also ruined the experience.
Overall I would have to rate the experience 0/10, but in the current year there isn't any multiplayer game I am able to rate higher than 0/10 so it is par for the course.",Negative

It's a hot summer day in Florida.
It's always hot. I hate dedust and heat of Florida.
She walks into my office. Directly up to my counter, and strikes up a conversation.
She looks tired. 
She'd been running around the community, avoiding the Mods.
I take a drag from the cigar.
It, held in my hand by my lifted index finger, my thumb leveraging the cigar, and my clutched middle finger.
The Mods... A vicious group of talented hackers and moderators, that have run the community.
Some benefit, others don't.
I exhale.
This community has been spiraling for a while. 
We used to have a proud population of nearly 70 thousand.
Now a days, we are lucky if we can get 20 thousand people in the community.
Most moved away from this cold place to a bright and warm Global world.
I take a second drag.
What is it?
I ask.
She tells me she wants to leave this place.
She says that even though she loves this place.
The air flows out of me.
[h1] There's Nothing Left Here for me [/h1]
I sigh.
I tell her, I was late here, I never saw what this community was like in it's heyday.
I admit.
There's only two reasons most people stay here.
Nothing but the bare bones of this community is original at this point.
I shift in my desk.
She begins to weep.
I take a drag of my cigar.
I admit to her the secret.
[h1]There's Only Two Reasons .....[/h1]
I pause and exhale.
Why anyone comes around these parts anymore.
Her eyes light up.
She says she has to know.
The poor.
Those who can't afford the Global world.
Riddled by capitalism's cruel nature.
And.
Her breath taken aback with anticipation.
Gary.
She gasps.
It's always been Gary.
Gary is at the heart of this city, and all who want to know Gary, must pass through here.
I take one last drag.
And toss the cigar into the ashtray.
[h1]I'll Save you the Boring Details [/h1]
I say as I reveal my suitcase.
Gary is enough for most people.
They'll stick through the crap in hopes of finding something in themselves with Gary.
It's enough for most people.
But it's not enough for me.
I walk to the door.
I'm leaving this town, I say.
And unless you're staying.
Well.
There's nothing more for me to come back to.

I just missed out on those days. I wasn't in my teen ages when CS came out. I couldn't experience what CS was like back in the day. 
And now i'm at 2020. Counter Strike has past it's prime days/years. Not many people play this game anymore. Now it sits as a staple of gaming history.",Negative

Thank you Steam, for ruining such a beautiful game thats been around for over 20 years. If you at least could make region based matchup. Like NOR-SWE-DAN. Youll experience a whole other type of game. When Finnish, Russian, Polish and Latvian's ect steps in to the game. Their profiles are filled with page after page with accuse. Coincidence? Steam, you fucked up.

One example: I had to manually delete C:\prog‚Ä¶\steamapps\common\Half life 
because it was added by one of those servers to add custom mods (still there after CS uninstall).

Yes, I am asking for a reimbursement right now.

The game is dead with maybe like 30 players in total and chances are you'll join a russian server just to get banned for speaking english or having an english name.
If you do manage to find a game where you won't be banned or kicked, you won't have much fun since the game is so buggy that everyone that dies looks like their standing up and gets you killed because you shot them instead of the one alive guy. I legit loaded into a game where everyone was t-posing.

fps_override = 1

fps_max = 1000 -> bhop impossible, GLUED to the ground for 1 second every time you jump, CAN'T WALK WHILE CROUCHED, CAN'T CROUCH IN VENTS

That's just one example of how fucking broken this game is. The timings are FPS dependant (what the fucK???) and it's CLIENTSIDE, not SERVERSIDE, so... If you want to cheat, you make a bind to set the max FPS to 20, and a bind to change it back to 50, 100 or 1000 which you use whenever you are not moving.

This game plays like CS:GO with shittier graphics and a buggy menu, also buying it now won't be worth it since the whole game is about multiplayer, and that won't last that long, since I don't think people will keep playing this game forever.

[h1]Reasons why you shouldn't buy or play this game:[/h1]
[list]
    [*]99% percent of community servers aren't English. That's self explanatory.
    [*]99% of community servers are actually cracked by using dproto, which lets non-legit users to connect. To find a steam only server is the same as finding a rare gem, I am not kidding.
    [*]100% of non-steam players can't get VAC banned. You know what it means.... Oh yeah, cheaters!!!!
    [*]100% of non-steam players can also ditch server-based bans too. All they have to do is use a steam id changer and bang, they are back with their hacks.
    [*]100% of non-steam players can and will steal your bought privileges or admin rights by changing their steamid to the one that matches yours, which is an identity theft. If they end up getting banned while using your id, well, you will be banned as well.
    [*]99% percent of the player base of cracked servers is non-steamers. Once again, good luck with playing against their hacks.
    [*]Hit boxes in this game turn out to be quite buggy, especially while planting, crouching or using ladders. Have you ever shot an AFK terrorist right in their forehead but didn't do any damage. Well, welcome to ""cs1.trash"".    
    [*]99% of community servers will alter your config or HUD files in one way or another, and obviously without your permission. Why? Because they simply can, which should not be a case. Don't be surprised that after visiting some fishy server, you would end up with a bunch of key binds that redirects you to various servers or spams advertisement messages in the game chat.
    [*]50% of servers use redirect loops in order to get all players on a different server. Ever had a case when you tried to join the NA server, but ended up in some Brazilian one? This is how redirect loop works. They host some fake server, with fake online in the different region of their original server, and once a player joins the fake server he gets instantly transferred anywhere they programmed. That's just pathetic to boost your online that way. It's just like ordering pizza, but getting a hamburger in the return. Would you be happy? No.  
    [*]99% of Eastern servers offers a free VIP for girl gamers that use a microphone. The owners of these servers must be horny af... Sexism at it's finest.

10,"V.alve is corrupted & their company should be closed down, the corrupted from the company need to pay me huge amount of money & they need to be jailed. Valve company should pay many billion of dollars for all their corruption & swindle they was behind.


In cs go, they disable my left click, freeze my screen in important moments, give me team flashers, kickers, griefers, team killers ONLY. They teleport enemies on my screen, if i am behind 5 enemies then all of them teleport to safety. If i am camping & 5 enemies walk ahead of me, then they just teleport over to a door. If enemies is in my crosshair then they teleport out of my crosshair when i shoot, all enemies teleport over my crosshair.
All enemies teleport from a dangerous spot to a safe spot. If there is 2 seconds of walk they would die at, then they teleport over that ''2 seconds of walk spot'' Alot more of these things was happening, they change binds, graphics & settings ingame all the time, i always had sabotaged 100% of my time in cs go + Dota2. When i should be 6k in dota 2 before i even tried the game & global elite MANY years before i tried cs go. They change my binds, sentivity & graphics all the time when i was ingame in cs go + dota2.
Valve company should be closed down for their corruption. valve sholdn't even be alowed to exist, they are corrupted psychopaths sabotaging 100% of my time in dota 2, cs go.
They are even disabling some of my hotkeys & doing that alot when i write reviews, so i need to change everything i wrote becourse 10% of the time one of my keyboard button was disabled by valve.

They are even freezing my screen for 1sec in any pvp game on steam, it just never happen in the many 1000s games i played outside steam.

Hello Fellow Soldiers,
This is easily a game that I have not played all that much. It was a great game for when it came out, and it's a lot of fun for what it is! Overall, the graphics and hitboxes are very poor, and I'm not going to recommend this game. Overall, I got this game in the Valve Complete Pack and I tried it because it was the first game that would spark the legendary Counter-Strike series. For the time it was great, now I'd recommend either getting Counter-Strike: Global Offensive or Counter-Strike: Source. I'm not going to recommend this game because there are newer and better versions of it out.

Back then it was fun, hard to master and a way to make friends. After today and many kicks, maps/mods downloading, server redirection (over and over) and players appearing out of nowhere (just around the corner that was safe),  i consider this game (in its current version) a real waste of time and a big disappointment.

After today i consider Counter-Strike just a poor man`s alternative to CS:GO, both in terms of price and hardware requirements.

10,"Horrible, just horrible. Everyone gives this good reviews based on nostalgia. I saw all the good reviews and thought I should try it out. Upon opening the game, was a cringy menu. I fiddle with the settings, and theres no damn graphics options! I put the crosshair on small.(Definitely not small) So, I go to servers and all the servers have horrible maps. Plus, closest servers had 0 players. I click on a Dust 2 server with 10 players. When it loads up, nobody speaks fucking english. The buy menu controls were so fucked up I couldnt buy a gun. So, I stuck with the pistol. I go through the middle, and all the players look the same! You cant even tell who's who. Literally, the fucking same. So I die instantly because i couldn't even tell it was an enemy. Bullshit. I finally managed to buy a gun in the fucked up menu. I find someone, spray at em', and surprisingly it was enemy. My gun starts shooting in the fucking sky, recoil over 9000, and I was burst firing! Absolute bullshit. Another HORRIBLE thing about this game, its graphics and audio! It just doesnt meet todays standards. I think I might have to bleach my eyes after glancing at this game. Its horrible. I only played the game for under 10 minutes and I already want to kill my self. Trust me, save your money. If you loved this game as a kid, I dont care get it. But if youre looking for a good FPS, to TODAYS standards, dont get this garbarge! Save your ten dollars and use it to get your dick sucked by the girl down the street. So, simplest way possible.

10,"Realmente, este jogo j√° foi melhor. Eu comprei ele ainda no come√ßo do ano, e nunca tive problema nenhum pra jogar. Mas agora, n√£o tem como jogar nada. Todos os servidores est√£o quebrados, e quando digo isso, estou falando dos tamanhos problemas de conex√£o que h√°. Qualquer servidor, mesmo os brasileiros com baixa lat√™ncia, vai dar lag e voc√™ vai cair do servidor do mesmo jeito que acontece se voc√™ entrar num servidor russo, por exemplo. Todos eles est√£o assim, quebrados, com problemas de conex√£o, e o que falar da hitreg e hitbox do jogo? o espa√ßo de tiro dos personagens est√£o todos com problemas, o conto de dano recebido e dado tamb√©m √© problem√°tico. Hoje em dia voc√™
pode dar um tiro de awp no peito de algu√©m, e pode acontecer dele sair vivo, ou o contr√°rio, de algu√©m te acertar no p√©, e voc√™ morrer na hora. J√° vi balas atravessarem os personagens e eles sa√≠rem sem dano, ou eles derramarem sangue, e sa√≠rem com 100 de hp. E a Valve nem a√≠ pro jogo. O jogo √© antigo, mas n√£o √© desculpa para n√£o monitor√°-lo e o deixar de lado. Quantas pessoas at√© hoje compram e jogam o jogo e se deparam com isso. Eu o comprei por que ele foi meu primeiro contato com jogos na inf√¢ncia, e s√≥ queria me divertir. Nem isso tem como.

10,"You are 14 years old, first time trying to play something multiplayer and online. You see this game, since you have a potatoe PC you start to play this game. Runs smoothly on 53 FPS, woow sounds are great, look an AK-47 but name CV-47 you play it you shoot, you get killed asking yourself how you didn't kill him cause you shot 27 bullets on that guy and he still is alive. You play it over and over, finally getting your first kill. (cause the enemy was coruching and looking the other way and you instantly kill him running 17 bullets spent) you get high hopes, I can play this game it is so easy. You get more kills, you get greedy you rush alone you get killed when you even thought about rushing by an AWP on mid. Ages pass, poeple pass, kills get comon. You start to play better, after 2 years you learn the recoils you learn the hidding spots, you know what is the enemy's next move. You practise your awp then. You play DM and DM only with an awp, your kills are slick, and your flicks are quick and accurate. Admin invites you to his clan. FIrst time you play this game with somenone for serious. You can't do anything cause you are not used to an opposite player to play smartly and you get owned, you don't do kills and your teammates question your skill. Couple more months pass you learn your duties as a teammate. You give info you cover you open. Clan gets closed down, you find another clan you are one of the best players. You play more switch clans for better ones. You get to LANs you get scared of the all expecations and so many eyes on you. You tilt and miss your shots, months pass, you get better, you become a man of steel and high nervous, 2000 hours pass you are finally a great player. 10 000 hours pass, you win LANs you play against better players, you try a gainst payed players you are toe-to-toe with them but you loose cause your team isn't on that level and they get scared. 20 000 hours pass game is dying and so is your love for this game. But no one can pay thoose voice chats from 8 P.M till 6 A.M every weekend with your friends. So much hours in this game and you acomplished nothing. You play against your local teams you get banned cause they don't expect somene to play that good without cheats and you stop playing this cause cheaters take over, very 12 year old first downloads a cheat then this game. You get mentally tortured cause the kid is telling you how bad you are and that you suck, you cry inside. Thinking what happened to me, how come this kid plays better then me, then you figure out the cheats are great, but you still play it fairly. You cry cause no one cares for e-sports in your country and no one wants to pay you for playing games. Your parents tell you you don't have a life you loose some friends, you loose your girlfriend you stop being active in sports. YOu just play this game hoping to be recognised, but you don't so to help everyone in this world after 30 000 hours on this game, don't play it it is a sinking ship and it is pulling you down. Tears are in my eyes for all the time I was good but now you can't play a normal match since cheaters will destory you... run READER, move away, press back and never turn back on this game..",Negative

i can definitely understand how majority of people love this game, they enjoyed it as a kid and just kept playing. back in the day, it was extremely popular and probably the best multiplayer shooter out there. countless LANs were held, and it was beginning of esports era. however, if you take off your nostalgia glasses, you have to see that cs1.6 is today outdated in almost every single aspect. i can't really recommend this game to new players that never played it before. i'd suggest maybe to try css or csgo, which will be much more enjoyable than 1.6 for new players.",Negative

Oh, how the might have fallen.  Nowadays, the game is plagued with a general lack of interest, as most of its fans have moved on to its vastly superior brothers, CSS and CSGO, and for good reason.

I would recommend playersonly play on servers they trust.  This is because apparently one server overwrote all of my unused keys to connect to ""xdd.ms-shadow.ro:27015"", which is also a server i would recommend avoiding at all costs.

10,"[h1] Is Counter-Strike: Global Offensive worth to buy? [/h1] - [b] Yes! [/b]

[i]Even if you are not really into the shooter genre, CS:GO is probably the best game to get things started. Not only does it have a huge variety in game modes and also community mods, it is the best game to reach a decent aim you can profit from in other shooters.[/i]

[h1] What mods can you play in CS:GO? [/h1]

[i]There are plenty, the mods variety is huge. I really have not played a lot of mods, since I am more into the competetive Counter-Strike, but I for example played zombie-mods, hunger-games-mods, surf maps (with and without rpg mod), bunnyhop and awp_noscope. [b]BUT[/b] there are many more mods to that.

[h1] What are the key aspects of the game? [/h1]
[list]
    [*] Casual: Bomb/Hostage Maps
    [*] Demolition: Bomb Maps
    [*] Gungame
    [*] Deathmatch
    [*] Competitive (Matchmaking)
[/list]

[b][u]Casual[/u][/b]
[i]In casual play mode, you will basicly spawn every round (1 life per round) and fight agains the opposite team (10 vs 10). You can play either bomb maps (where you have to plant/defuse a bomb) or hostage maps (where you have to defend hostages or rescue them). You can choose between the official competetive map pool (which does not include hostage maps) or reserve group (where you have both types). You will usually spawn with kevlar+helmet, and defuse kit (not on hostage maps).[/i]

[b][u]Demolition[/u][/b]
[i]In demolition play mode you play 5v5 on small bomb maps and you also have only one live. You spawn with kevlar+helmet and a weapon that will change ever round where you have killed an enemy (+grenades if you make multiple kills the same round).[/i]

[b][u]Gungame[/u][/b]
[i]In gungame play mode you will play 10v10 on small gungame maps, where you have to kill an enemy with a pre-set weapon (everyone starts with the same weapons). Once you killed two enemies, you will progress to the next weapon. You win after you reached knife level and killed a player with the ""golden knife"". [b] Note:[/b] Every player must go through the same exact weapons to win and the weapons are randomized.[/i]

[b][u]Deathmatch[/u][/b]
[i]In deathmatch play mode you will play 10v10 on the same maps as on casual play mode. You will spawn with the weapons you choose through the buymenu (kevlar+helmet are already purchased for you). You have multiple lives and can always change your weapons after you died. One game ends after 10 Minutes and the winner with the highest score wins. You gain points by killing enemies or assist in killing them OR by killing chickens (which gives 1 point only per chicken).[/i]

[b][u]Competitive (Matchmaking)[/u][/b]
[i]In competitive play mode, you will basicly play like casual but different. You will play 5v5 with people of your same skillgroup on the same maps as on casual (You can choose specific maps!!). If you want to get serious with Counter-Strike this will be the game mode you are looking for, BUT keep in mind that you need a lot of knowledge about the game for this type of play mode (and you need at least community rank 3 to play competitive).[/i]


[b]>> Note: [/b] [spoiler] Keep in mind, that the game changes a lot, so do the game modes. I wrote this 29.01.2016, so any changes after I probably did not predict ;) [/spoiler]

[code] So all in all Counter-Strike is at the moment my favorite shooter, since all others (even new ones like ""Rainbow Six Siege"") are not as much fun as Counter-Strike is. Especially the competitive aspect of the game is way better than others. [/code]

This is evidenced by thousands of hours on many of the players records; keep in mind that Steam has not been tracking game hours for a good few years after it first came out with this mod!

I highly suggest one passes by this out of date game, as classic as it may be. I compare an exaggeration of the experience for a new player to that of being anally entered, spontaneously, by barbed nethers. Overwhelming, painful, and a strong sense of defenselessness.

One would do well to instead spend their time playing the latest, ""sexiest"" version, anyway. After all, the gameplay is an evolution on the one this game has to offer. I also recommend passing over the current middle-child version: Source.",Negative

10,"Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is the current iteration of Valve‚Äôs top-in-class competitive shooter, and the first to be maintained in the very modern way it has been. Learning from its experience with Team Fortress 2, Valve has a miniature economy in CS: GO that revolves entirely around gun decals. Players get a few ‚Äòdrops‚Äô a week after matches, which can be a gun decal or a weapon crate ‚Äì the latter of which cost ¬£1.49 to unlock with a one-use key from the store. Obviously this economy is tailor-made, and so there are extraordinarily rare and mysteriously fantastic-looking gun and knife skins (with prices in the hundreds of pounds), then a large range of other skins tapering down to the common-as-muck variety that trades for pennies.

I don‚Äôt pay much attention to the CS: GO economy as a whole, though it‚Äôs interesting enough, but it‚Äôs important for a non-player to understand that a big chunk of the game‚Äôs audience takes it very seriously indeed. In the days after a new Operation launches countless forum threads are launched about the value of the new goods, whether someone should sell this new rare drop they got or hold it for a while, Twitch streams with giveaways and 50 crates being unlocked and so on. You get the picture.



I give such context on CS: GO‚Äôs economy because ‚Äì even though it is a subsidiary part of the game to many including myself ‚Äì it is the molten core of Operation Vanguard. CS: GO is a regularly-patched game but the major updates come in the form of Operations that introduce new maps and new skins, at the price of around ¬£3 for an access pass ‚Äì with the nice touch that maps are available to all players regardless, or made so shortly afterwards.

To give an exhaustive history of Operations would be no more useful than a general overview. If you play Counter-Strike then the chances are you play a lot of Counter-Strike. What the Operations do is freshen things up a bit ‚Äì naturally they don‚Äôt disrupt the regular Dust-Mirage-Inferno cycle of competitive play, but you get some unfamiliar environments to tool about in, the chance to score some fancy new weapons, and in the context of a game you play almost daily, ¬£3 a few times a year is chicken feed.

Operation Vanguard is different, and the changes are not for the better. The first problem I have with it is major: the way it‚Äôs sold seems to skirt the borderline of deception. To participate in Operation Breakout you bought an ‚ÄòAll-Access Pass‚Äô for ¬£2.39. To participate in Operation Vanguard I bought an ‚ÄòAccess Pass‚Äô for ¬£2.39. The difference is obvious side-by-side, but of course when OV popped up in Counter-Strike‚Äôs home menu I bought it more or less instantly, thinking this was the same thing.

OV‚Äôs selling point is two ‚Äòcampaigns,‚Äô a series of missions with three branching paths. The missions are things like ‚ÄòWin 16 rounds on map X‚Äô and ‚ÄòKill 20 chickens in Deathmatch mode,‚Äô and completing one bags a pre-determined award ‚Äì either a weapon crate or a random weapon from a specified collection. So far, so OK. But in fact OV has two more campaigns, both of which cost ¬£1.79 to access ‚Äì which follow more or less the same pattern.



To be crystal-clear about this, the money is not the problem. I‚Äôm happy to pay for Operations, and OV‚Äôs combined total of around ¬£6 in the context of the time I put into Counter-Strike is really not an issue. But that switch from ‚ÄòAll-Access Pass‚Äô to ‚ÄòAccess Pass (with the right to buy more access)‚Äô, just pissed me right off.

First of all I felt conned. I bought the OV pass in the same way I‚Äôd bought all the previous Operation passes, expected it to be the same deal, and realised I‚Äôd been fooled by the removal of ‚ÄòAll.‚Äô Secondly, what the two ‚Äòextra‚Äô purchases offer is basically a re-skinned version of OV‚Äôs mission book. But thirdly, and this is the real killer, you‚Äôre encouraged to buy them to self-medicate the most egregious, enormous, climactically wrong and frankly offensive design decision in Vanguard.

There are multi-day cooldowns on missions. That‚Äôs right Rambo, you may have thought you were buying another set of missions and drops to liven up day-to-day business in CS: GO, but in fact Vanguard is a campaign designed to play out over a set period of time, with the only limiting factor a bald external one: cooldown timers.

Let me set the scene for you. I love Counter-Strike. I saw Vanguard was out on a Thursday, and cleared Friday night. Got in a few beers. Booted it up and bought the pass. I played the first mission, cleared it in about 15 minutes. Chose a second, the killing chickens one, and that was another 15 mins. So around half an hour into my evening of joy I was given a four-day cooldown for the next mission.



You can slice this any way you want, but it‚Äôs bullshit. The sad thing is I get the thought process behind it. Consider: you‚Äôre Valve, in charge of a game where players (a) want new content but (b) put in so many hours that they‚Äôll rush through anything almost instantly. For example, mission chains. Operation Breakout introduced missions in the form of random drops, which parcelled them out over time but had no larger arc. It was fine but the missions never felt‚Ä¶ important. So Operation Vanguard‚Äôs missions are in structured patterns, with defined rewards, and are given the desired longevity through simple brute force of timing. You will not complete this content before we say so, because you can‚Äôt.

Oh, except that if you buy the extra mission packs, your cooldowns decrease across the board, because now you‚Äôre allowed to do more missions in a set period. That‚Äôs right. You‚Äôre basically paying to reduce cooldowns. In a Valve game.

The thing is that Operation Vanguard is only a ‚Äòcampaign‚Äô in the same way that a pile of biscuits is ‚Äòlunch.‚Äô The missions are basic objectives like ‚ÄòWin 16 competitive rounds on Season‚Äô or ‚ÄòGet 100 FAMAS kills in Deathmatch mode.‚Äô And what do you get for completing them? Either a drop from an existing collection of guns, with a minor chance of a rare gun, or a weapon crate. The first is fair enough, but the second‚Ä¶ I mean, at this point I already felt pretty rinsed by Operation Vanguard, and now it‚Äôs ‚Äòrewarding‚Äô me with crates that I need to pay more money to open.



There is a school of thought that says Valve has done this in order that a flood of new crates and mission rewards doesn‚Äôt flood the in-game economy, instead trickling them in over the coming months. To that argument the only appropriate response is ‚Äì who cares? I play Counter-Strike: GO because it‚Äôs a great game, I don‚Äôt play it because of the economy, and while I accept the latter is how Valve makes money, the moment it starts intruding into the game ‚Äì if indeed this explanation holds water ‚Äì then the economy is not acting in the way that it should. That is, it should be improving the experience rather than throttling it.

The sad thing is that Operation Vanguard comes with my favourite selection of community maps yet, including two in Season and Back Alley that feel like potential classics. Yeah they‚Äôre all over the place in terms of favouring one side or the other, but this is par for the course with CS: GO and will be tweaked over the coming months. Every CS: GO operation freshens the game up with some new environments if nothing else, and the point of Operation Vanguard‚Äôs structure is to elongate this beyond a few days ‚Äì to really showcase these excellent maps by forcing people to play on them semi-regularly for missions. It at least manages this.

10,"EDIT: And on top of that, game is unsafe from exploits that will ara-ara as much of your game files and maybe PC as possible, admin being able to force certain commands on client too, have fun.

Counter-Strike, this one also known as Counter-Strike 1.6, is a team-based multiplayer realistical/military shooter. And a very well known one at that. It was first available as a free mod for Half-Life 1, being patched regulary up to version 1.6, until recently it got it's way onto Steam, as a serapately sold title.

So, how is the player base? Counter-strike 1.6, being popular self, has an active player base. You will see many servers, up to 32 players. At very least there are many Russian servers, as it had a cult following over there, can't really see past them. On bad side, most seems to prefer ""Terrorist plant C4"" mode and then De_Dust2 is the most played map. A lot of servers run small mods, that may alter balance or other small things. And most of it, playerbase had a lot of time to play and master this game, so new players will be more frustated than having fun learning.

Counter-Strike is a very well known realistical FPS. It gained it's popularity while being free mod for popular Half-Life, because it provided something else what wasn't overused yet - realistical shootouts (using models of real weapons, you know) in team multiplayer. Unforgiving and furious. Or unbalanced and twitchy one-shot kills with headshots. Whichever one you prefer. 

Counter-Strike has two types of map. First, ""de"", is a mode where counter-terrorists have do defends few market spots on map from terrorist. One of the terrorists spawns with C4 in inventrory and has to bring it to one of the marked spots to plant it adn start to countdown of T's victory. Roles change as Terrorists will have now to defend this place from CTs, who's aim now are to defuse the bomb, in which case CTs will win the round, no matter how many more Ts are left. Pretty interesting mode and most played, otherwise this game would have been camping fest. And if one site is too well defended, Ts can go to another one. And then there is a second type, ""cs"", in which CTs have to to rescue hostages by bringing them back to base. The problem there, is that hostage NPCs aren't perfect (though good enough) and since CTs have to rescue them all, Terrorist can camp in one of the spots around them, since CTs will have no choice but to come to win. Much less played and even if it does, it goes like your everyday Team Deathmatch, just killing all of opposite team. Much simpler anyway.

Now, the core gameplay... There are few rounds. Each round starts with each team spawning on their side of map. There is no respawning during round, once person is dead he is out, so you will have to worry much more about getting insta-killed. There are no items placed on map itself either (on correct, official maps), no kind of medikits. In spawn place, you have 15 seconds to press ""b"" button (or whichever you set) to bring up ""buy menu"", where you purchase weapons and equipment for the round witht he money that you earned so far. Yep, when round ends everybody gets some sum of money to spend, with winning team getting more, an ingenius design decision that helps losing team to get steamrolled even harder. What you can buy there is a pistol, primary weapon and any of the equipment. (Yep, if it doesn't smell like prototype of modern military shooters)
Once past purchase screen, you are free to run and shoot. And here comes the art of recoil and aiming. For you see, one of the more important thing that is used in this game is accuaricy of your weapon. If you move it drops. if you jump, it drops. It drops while you are shooting too. Thus it becomes more importanly to get good position, making assaults more compilated, and you often have to relearn to shoot, making few clicks instead of just holding down mouse button. You will have to be often walking instead of running, to keep accuaricy while moving (it also makes you silent, so do it often), or just stand and crouch sometimes. Burst shooting is better there and for long range targets you want to be just click few times. Another important thing is that you can shoot through some walls with more powerful primary weapons. So don't be surprised for people shooting through door, walls and even just over the corner, it indeed does small damage to whoever is behind. The game also emphasises aiming because it supports headshots and they do a MASSIVE damage. And you also got three kinds of grenades. Explosive (HE), which explodes, good for throwing into chokepoints. Flashbang, which blinds whoever looked at it when it blows for few seconds, quite annoying but good for stroming into room. And Smoke Grenade, when you don't want enemies to see you coming and don't want to be under direct fire, good for open spaces with snipers (who instakill you when you peek around corner). Protip: You run slightly faster with knife out.

And well, while on theory it sounds interesting, as well as empashises teamwork. here comes the downfall of the game. The weapons, while make people with gun fetish happy, are badly balanced around each other. There are just best and bad weapons. From pistols Desert Eagle is the best, they behave as backup when you got no time to reload primary weapon. Shotguns are theorically good for close range but in this game they are useless and Assault Rifles can kill even better at close range. Sub-Machine Guns category had advantage of no accuaricy drops while moving, but are still inferior to Rifles. Rifles category has two best guns: all-range assault rifle like AK-47 and all-range sniper rifle like AWP (which doesn't even require headshot to one-hit kill), exactly what majority of people use. The only Machine Gun is ""pew pew pew can't hit"".
And all-range is all-range, random is random. You may run and shoot in general direction of enemy and pull off a headshot from your AK-47 by luck. Or you may walk around corner, thinking of your next grandious tactical plan, just to get headshotted in insta-second by guy with sniper rifle from close range. It's just so full of cheap and frustating, the rage is probably the main thing that keeps players coming back for more, not honest fun, as well as luck of possibly pulling few magical headshots. Slow-down when being hit doesn't seem to be good idea either, making it harder to get away from the choke points. And random spread is not actually random, it just randomly follows one of the pre-set pattern. And yes, if you will learn them, you will be able to control your shooting better and get on top. Exactly what puts apart newbiews and elites, and exactly what elites seem to boast about when they want to say that Counter-Strike 1.6 is the best because it takes more skills and time to learn, with artifical challenges like this one that makes little sense. And well, once you spend your time to learn them, you will still find out on top that it didn't make the game any more amazing.

But you know, it's not too bad. It does teamwork well. Sometimes the game just works. When you work along the team, round the corners and storming the next room, where you follow teammates, supporting each other. Provide covering fire to the corner. When upon entering next place, each one covers his own direction, as some of the rooms just have too many places from which enemies can shoot you (smoke grenade and flashbangs help in these cases). And it's pretty damn nice at those moments, until they get ruined by something stupid, something you don't feel like could be prevented. Yea, getting shot by sniper.

Can't really recommend it. Because everybody who will like such games are already playing it. And player base of this game had too much time by now, that they will be just way too skilled for new players, who will just get destroyed and it will take a long time to get onto same level.

I went to it on a daily basis, for several hours, as my main source of entertainment and gathering of friends until about 2002, when other activities came along. I only went back to it now, in 2012. This unveiled the greatest disappointment and proof of destruction of a game I have ever experienced. As it is today, this is not Counter-Strike. It is a broken, unrecognizable, nearly useless form of the original game. Valve has let this game rot to death and still make an easy profit for nothing. The server browser is a joke. It is simply broken. The results it returns are completely inaccurate and all servers you will find are run by non-Steam users, with the game settings altered to who knows what, and 90% of them playing the Dust map. The other servers are running non-official maps and pointless game modes. In addition, you can not set your client to disallow the automatic download of custom server sounds or other trash that is force-fed through your connection to alter the game. Counter-Strike has been so blatantly abandoned, that it is shocking Valve still charges something for it. You will also see advertisements while you are connecting to the servers, and while you wait for the next round once you have been killed.

I played this alone and still funny and good, is more fun if u play with friends, FOR REAL U SHOULD TO PLAY IT AGAIN, is good game if u join on the correct server, i give this game a rate of 9/10 because all people when was a kid start to play this, zombie gamemode or jail specially, this gamemodes was the most played in the old years, so nostalgic, if u dont know what to play and u want to change the gameplay, this is for you",Positive

10,"I am a 55 year old biker and trucker father, and probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 15 now. My son got this game for from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 12 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he let me borrow his controller. Me and my son then played in turns and I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my son many happy memories.",Positive

Having said that, the shooting is very different from the Source/Source 2 engine games. It is much more ""skill-required"" than the source Counter-Strikes, as it punishes even the slightest of mistakes or inaccuracies.

In primu rand si in primu rand, cumparati domne cartofii domne cum sa faci tu cartofi prajiti fara cartofi, si luati si uleiu ala domne ca nu se sfaraiesc bine cartofii fara ulei. Apoi dupa luati o tigaie de la doamna Mariana din bucatarie si ii dati in cap ca  are curu mare. Urmatorul pas este sa dati drumu la foc si sa il lasati sa zboare domne ca se sufoca. Puneti ulei sa sfaraiasca si dupa puneti cartofii taiati si spalati ca voi sunteti niste putori de nelegat ce nu se poate sta langa voi , si ii puneti in ulei.

10,"Counter-Strike 1.6 wasn‚Äôt just a game‚Äîit was an era, a phenomenon, and for many of us, the defining title of our childhood. It consumed thousands of hours of my time, and every single one of them was worth it. This was the game that brought friends together, kept us glued to our screens for hours, and sparked endless laughter, camaraderie, and, yes, the occasional curse when a cheater ruined the perfect match.

""Having a Steam account"" back then was a badge of honor, a sign that you were serious about your gaming. The competitive scene, led by legends like s1mple, was absolutely thrilling, and PGL (Professional Gaming League) tournaments were the stuff of legend, inspiring players around the world.

Beyond the standard maps and game modes, CS 1.6‚Äôs vibrant modding community gave us an endless variety of experiences. From bunny hopping (B-hop) to zombie survival, superhero mods, and countless others, there was always something new to explore and master. Each mod added its own twist, making the game feel endlessly fresh and replayable.

Counter-Strike 1.6 was more than just a game‚Äîit was a culture, a community, and a treasure trove of unforgettable memories. Thank you, CS 1.6, for the endless hours of joy, frustration, and nostalgia.

A timeless classic that defined a generation of gamers!",Positive

I have very nostalgic memories of this game. Along with Minecraft, Half-Life, and Slender, this is the most nostalgic game ever made. I remember it like it was yesterday‚Äîthe day I bought the pirated DVD of CS 1.5, which came with the Bot mod, because yes, the game didn‚Äôt have Bots natively. I didn‚Äôt even have internet access, and I played it on a tube monitor on my first computer, a Windows XP given to me by my mom‚Äôs boss.
 
I played this game so much, I‚Äôd stay up all night and go to school exhausted. I played each map thousands of times, and when I got older, I played against my friends in a LAN house. Oh, so many memories. I feel so happy remembering those moments, of people who are no longer here, of simpler times in life‚Ä¶
 
This game is a milestone in my life, and in the lives of millions of kids and adults. To Valve, Minh Le, and Jess Cliffe (the creators of the original mod), I extend my sincerest thanks. Thank you for this masterpiece, and for the great moments it provided for an entire generation.",Positive

10,"Can't believe I never wrote a review for this. I spent a good portion of my childhood on [AoG] Servers. Gun game, zombie escape, you name it. I was a regular every night from 4 to 11 PM. Eventually I learned about Kz servers, I sucked at them, but I had fun just taking my time and climbing. Thousands of hours on community servers, my aim was unmatched at one point.
Eventually my computer broke and I had to work summers to get a new one, after a while I bought onne and found out I could play TF2 on it. So that was the end of my (totally legit) copy of Counter Strike 1.6.

A love letter to online gaming, iconic. Thank you Valve.",Positive

This game has truly touched and changed my life in a way and would love if i could go back then as oppose to now with a lot of servers being out dated or not managed. Cheaters will be on arise as the years goes forward not much can be done, but still a classic to throw on and play with friends for a quick match-ups. I would rate this game 7.5 / 10

This game is absolute classic!

Undoubtedly, cs 1.6 has come a long way from just a mod for the half-life 1 to the most popular multiplayer shooter of all across the world.
 
People STILL playing the game, that says a lot for me.

You can go on standard tactical maps like ""de"" and ""cs"", or have fun on maps like ""aim"", ""35hp"", ""dm"", ""surf"" e.t.c.

Definitely recommend this masterpiece even to this day.

10,"Counter-Strike 1.6 isn't just a game; it's a phenomenon.  Released in 2000 as a mod for Half-Life, it became a global sensation, defining competitive FPS gaming for a generation. Even today, it retains a dedicated following, a testament to its enduring appeal. Here's a deep dive into what makes CS 1.6 so special:

Gameplay that Defined a Genre:

Pure Tactical FPS: CS 1.6 strips away complex mechanics and focuses on core gunplay and strategy. Every round is a tense chess match, with players utilizing teamwork, map knowledge, and precise aiming to outmaneuver their opponents.
Iconic Weapons: The AK-47, the AWP, the Desert Eagle ‚Äì these weapons are not just tools; they're legendary. Each has its own distinct feel and mastery requires understanding its recoil, accuracy, and effective range.
Round-Based Economy: The buy system adds a layer of strategic depth. Managing your money to purchase the right weapons and equipment each round is crucial for success.
Diverse Maps: From the claustrophobic corridors of de_dust2 to the open spaces of de_inferno, each map offers unique challenges and tactical possibilities. Learning the intricacies of each map is key to competitive play.
A Legacy of Competition:

Esports Pioneer: CS 1.6 laid the foundation for modern esports. Tournaments like CPL and WCG showcased incredible skill and fostered a thriving competitive scene.
Community Driven: The game's longevity is largely thanks to its passionate community. Countless mods, maps, and skins were created, extending the game's lifespan and providing endless variety.
Skill-Based Progression: CS 1.6 rewards dedication and practice. Improving your aim, movement, and game sense provides a tangible sense of accomplishment.
Why It Still Holds Up:

Nostalgia Factor: For many, CS 1.6 evokes powerful memories of LAN parties, internet cafes, and early online gaming experiences.
Accessibility: The game's low system requirements make it accessible to a wide range of players, even on older hardware.
Pure Gameplay: In an era of complex FPS games with intricate mechanics, CS 1.6's simplicity is refreshing. It's a game about skill, not perks or unlocks.
However, it's not without its flaws:

Dated Graphics: By today's standards, the visuals are undeniably dated.
Cheating: Unfortunately, cheating can be a problem in online play.
Limited Content: Compared to modern FPS games, the number of maps and weapons is limited.
Overall:

Counter-Strike 1.6 is a timeless classic that continues to entertain and challenge players. Its impact on the FPS genre and esports is undeniable. If you're looking for a pure, skill-based FPS experience with a rich history and dedicated community, CS 1.6 is still worth playing today. It's a reminder that sometimes, simplicity is key.

10,Counter Strike 1.6 is one of the best FPS games ever. 10/10 I think that being such a simple game is what makes it so good.

10,"**Title: The Classic That Defined Team-Based Shooters!**

‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è

""Counter-Strike"" is a legendary title that has left an indelible mark on the gaming landscape since its release in 1999 as a mod for Half-Life. Over the years, it has evolved into a staple of competitive gaming and remains one of the most influential first-person shooters of all time. Here‚Äôs a detailed review of what makes the original ""Counter-Strike"" so special:

### Gameplay
At its heart, ""Counter-Strike"" is all about team-based tactics and strategy. Players join either the Terrorists or Counter-Terrorists in various game modes, including Bomb Defusal and Hostage Rescue. The gameplay emphasizes teamwork, communication, and strategic planning over mindless shooting.

**Mechanics:**
The gunplay is precise, requiring skill and practice to master. The economy system adds a layer of strategy‚Äîplayers earn money based on their performance and can buy weapons and equipment at the start of each round. This aspect makes each match a careful balancing act between risk and reward.

### Maps and Design
The original game features classic maps like Dust II, Aztec, and Inferno, each with its own unique layout and tactical opportunities. The map design is meticulous, promoting various playstyles and strategies. Learning the intricacies of each map is essential for success, adding to the depth of gameplay.

### Community and Competitive Scene
""Counter-Strike"" boasts a passionate community that has kept the game alive for decades. The competitive scene is robust, with numerous tournaments and leagues that continue to attract skilled players. The community-created content, including maps and mods, has expanded the game‚Äôs longevity and variety.

### Graphics and Sound
While the graphics may seem dated by today‚Äôs standards, they were groundbreaking at the time and still hold a certain charm. The sound design is crucial, providing players with audio cues that enhance situational awareness, such as footsteps and gunfire. Mastering these cues can give players a significant edge in matches.

### Accessibility
Despite its competitive nature, ""Counter-Strike"" remains accessible to newcomers. Tutorials and community resources help players learn the basics, and the matchmaking system allows for fair matches based on skill levels. However, mastering the game takes time and dedication.

### Conclusion
""Counter-Strike"" is more than just a game; it‚Äôs a phenomenon that has shaped the first-person shooter genre. Its focus on teamwork, strategy, and skill makes it a timeless classic. If you‚Äôre looking for an engaging, competitive experience that rewards dedication and practice, you can‚Äôt go wrong with ""Counter-Strike.""

10,"My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn.
Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a ""hit"" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is.",Positive

10,"[h1] Counter-Strike: The Birth of Tactical Multiplayer Shooters [/h1]

Overall Rating: ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ

Released in 2000, Counter-Strike quickly became one of the most iconic and influential first-person shooters in gaming history. Initially a mod for Half-Life, it revolutionized multiplayer gaming with its emphasis on strategy, teamwork, and skill-based gameplay. Even after two decades, the game's legacy continues to shape competitive shooters.

Gameplay: ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ
Counter-Strike‚Äôs core gameplay centers around two teams‚ÄîTerrorists and Counter-Terrorists‚Äîcompeting in objective-based rounds. Whether it's planting or defusing bombs or rescuing hostages, the game focuses heavily on teamwork and tactical decision-making. The one-life-per-round system adds intensity, as each decision carries significant weight. Unlike many shooters of the time, there‚Äôs no respawning until the round is over, raising the stakes for every encounter.

Maps & Level Design: ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ
The original maps like de_dust and de_inferno became legendary for their balance and design, enabling various playstyles from sniping to close-quarters combat. The maps were crafted with tactical positioning in mind, and players had to learn choke points, hiding spots, and timing to master them.

Weapons & Economy: ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ
The weapon selection was diverse yet balanced, offering a range of pistols, rifles, and grenades. The economic system added depth, requiring players to spend money wisely between rounds to buy better gear or save for future rounds. This resource management became a critical aspect of the game‚Äôs strategy.

Graphics & Sound: ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜ
Given that it was released in 2000, the graphics now look dated compared to modern shooters, but at the time, they were more than adequate. The sound design, particularly for footsteps and gunfire, was crucial for competitive play, offering an additional layer of tactical awareness.

Impact & Legacy: ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ
Counter-Strike not only birthed a competitive gaming scene but also laid the foundation for modern esports. Its simple yet deeply strategic gameplay has spawned numerous sequels, spin-offs, and millions of devoted fans. Even in 2023, the game‚Äôs influence is felt across every tactical shooter released.

Conclusion:
Counter-Strike (2000) changed the landscape of multiplayer shooters, introducing an unprecedented level of depth and strategy. Its addictive, team-based gameplay and competitive focus have ensured its place in gaming history. For those seeking the roots of tactical shooters, there‚Äôs no better place to look than the original Counter-Strike.",Positive

10,"The Timeless Classic: Counter-Strike

Counter-Strike is the granddaddy of multiplayer FPS games, and boy does it deliver! As the game that set the gold standard for team-based tactical shooters, it‚Äôs where countless gamers, including myself, cut their teeth. I grew up playing Counter-Strike, and those memories are some of my fondest gaming moments.

From the thrilling rush of defusing bombs to the intense rescue missions, every round is packed with adrenaline. The camaraderie and occasional friendly rage with friends made it an unforgettable experience. Whether you‚Äôre strategizing with your team or cursing out that one guy who always seems to have the perfect aim, Counter-Strike is a blast from start to finish. It‚Äôs not just a game; it‚Äôs a legend that defined an era of online gaming.

10,"Counter-Strike is, without a doubt, one of the most battle-tested and refined games in the history of first-person shooters. Over two decades after its initial release, it remains the go-to for anyone seeking a tactical and competitive experience. 

Released back in 2000, Counter-Strike didn‚Äôt just bring us into the world of strategic team-based gameplay‚Äîit defined it. The game's blend of fast-paced action and strategic depth has not only aged well but continues to set the bar for competitive shooters. It‚Äôs the granddaddy of them all, but this granddad is still hitting the gym and challenging the younger generation to keep up.

The gameplay is as sharp as ever. Every round in Counter-Strike is a high-stakes, adrenaline-pumping affair where precision, timing, and teamwork are key. Whether you‚Äôre planting bombs, rescuing hostages, or just trying to stay alive, the intensity never fades. The graphics might not compare to the eye-popping visuals of modern titles, but the minimalistic design is a testament to its era, focusing purely on gameplay over flashy visuals.

What truly stands out is how well Counter-Strike has maintained its relevance. The community around the game is still thriving, proving that even without the bells and whistles of modern engines or high-end graphics, quality gameplay shines through. Even today, its influence is felt across many modern shooters, making it a classic that's still in active play‚Äã.

So, if you're looking for a game that's as challenging as it is rewarding, and you don't mind a bit of a retro feel, Counter-Strike is still worth your time. Whether you're a veteran or a newcomer, there's something timeless about jumping into a match and testing your skills in a game that's been honing its craft for over two decades.",Positive

Those who experienced these things that made the game from just a first person shooter to a god game status will be treasured for the remainder of their lives. Unfortunately these teachings will be lost to time Its very sad most people will never get to see it at its peak.

10,"Starting as a mod for Half-Life, CS had some key differences that made it stand out in competitive FPS games at the time. 1- The modern settings when most FPS games were Science Fantasy 2- CS is strictly team based, making communication and teamwork crucial. 3- No respawns during a round accentuated and intensified each encounter. 4- Asymmetric objectives for the two teams prevented monotony. 5- Purchasable equipment added a layer of strategy to the game beyond shooting players to score points.

10,"truly a classic game, but unfortunately it ruined PC gaming by being too good. 1.5 was the pinnacle of competitive gaming and esports. The addition of steam and update 1.6 was still a very solid game, but it spelled the end of an era and led us on the path of the source engine which ruined pc gaming. No game has ever come close to the magic of 1.5/1.6, and the lingering residue of it's greatness continues to attract new players to the franchise despite the later entries being soulless shadows of the original.",Positive

10,Fantastic game. I really like moving in 3d and moving in real life. Helpful and fun.,Positive
10,best time in life,Positive
10,"I really like Counter-Strike 1.6 for several reasons.

Firstly, the classic gameplay is timeless and highly addictive. As one of the pioneers of the tactical first-person shooter genre, Counter-Strike 1.6 offers a perfect blend of strategy, skill, and fast-paced action. The simple yet deep mechanics require precision, teamwork, and quick reflexes, making every match thrilling and rewarding.

Secondly, the map design is exceptional. Iconic maps like Dust2, Inferno, and Nuke are expertly crafted, offering balanced and engaging environments for both attackers and defenders. The layout of these maps promotes strategic play and offers countless opportunities for memorable moments and tactical maneuvers.

The community and mod support are another highlight. Counter-Strike 1.6 has a dedicated and passionate player base that continues to create custom maps, mods, and game modes. This community-driven content keeps the game fresh and provides endless variety and replayability.

The competitive nature of the game is a significant draw. Whether playing casually with friends or participating in intense competitive matches, Counter-Strike 1.6 offers a highly competitive environment that can be both challenging and immensely satisfying. The skill-based gameplay ensures that victories feel earned and rewarding.

Performance and accessibility are also strengths of Counter-Strike 1.6. The game runs smoothly on almost any modern hardware, making it accessible to a wide range of players. Its straightforward mechanics and minimal system requirements mean that anyone can jump in and start playing.

However, there are a few drawbacks. The graphics and visuals are dated compared to modern titles. While the gameplay remains solid, the game's visual fidelity may not appeal to players used to more contemporary graphics.

Learning curve can be steep for new players. Mastering the mechanics, maps, and strategies takes time and practice, which can be daunting for newcomers.

The game can also suffer from occasional cheaters and hackers, which can disrupt the fairness and enjoyment of matches. While community servers and anti-cheat measures help mitigate this issue, it can still be a problem.

Lastly, the lack of built-in matchmaking and modern features can be a downside. Unlike newer titles, Counter-Strike 1.6 does not have advanced matchmaking systems, leading to potential imbalance in player skill levels during casual matches.

Overall, Counter-Strike 1.6 is a classic and highly influential game that continues to offer a compelling and rewarding experience. Its timeless gameplay, exceptional map design, and strong community support make it a standout title in the tactical shooter genre. Despite some dated visuals, a steep learning curve, occasional cheaters, and lack of modern features, the game's strengths make it well worth playing.

Verdict: If you appreciate tactical shooters and want to experience a piece of gaming history with deep, skill-based gameplay, Counter-Strike 1.6 is a must-play. Its enduring appeal and competitive nature make it a timeless classic.",Positive

10,"Still a masterpiece. 

It's insane how after all these years this Half-Life mod turned full game is still so damn fun. Great sound design, low latency, challenging mechanics, good hitreg, and amazing movement. I really wish the modern CS titles had the same low stamina cost and crisp feeling of the movement in this game, even if it's still fun and maybe more balanced in CS2. Like crouch jumping onto a crate is instant and it just feels right, and bhopping is super easy compared to CS2. 

Walls are also ""paper-thin""in this game, but I love that and I feel like if you can't shoot through concrete, you can't call yourself a rifle. Most guns in reality can shoot through concrete easily. Even still, you don't take full damage from wallbangs, and you really gotta line yourself up so I'd say it's balanced. HE grenades damaging through walls and Wallbangs make the game  function surprisingly well even without molotovs or modern grenade lineups.

The more I play this game, the more I understand why so many 1.6 players keep saying they miss 1.6 or think it's better than GO or 2. It's still distinctly Counter-Strike without all the BS that would later come like skins, (which includes renting them which is just such a CS2 thing,) in-game gambling, and restricting choosing your own character models. Plus the amount of mods you can put on this game is another major pro compared to the modern CS titles. You can turn this shit into CS:GO or Valorant with a few steps, just check on YouTube.

The only mods I feel are necessities would be installing Bots, and Exploding Headshot, both of which you can find on gamebanana.com. Anything else is a bonus in my opinion (and free).

Overall, I will concede that CS2 and CS:GO are more balanced and accessible, and are generally taking the franchise further in a better direction. Dedicated matchmaking, more accurate weapons, more viable weapons, smokes actually obstructing vision, cross-map grenade lineups, and more are all things this franchise has improved on over the years and things CS2 features. However, being the diehard fan that I am of Counter-Strike, there is no surprise to me that this game still gets 15k+ players after all these years later. You can't kill what's already a masterpiece. Long live 1.6.",Positive

10,"I don't know what it is, but I actually prefer the shooting mechanics of the original, compared to the more recent editions. It's just smoother and more rewarding than anything that has come after it, even despite the limitations of the engine. I'm personally more of a fan of the run-and-gun types of shooters, such as Xonotic (not on Steam). I'm aware that this type of gameplay was not the design goal of Counter-Strike, but even so, I seem to enjoy playing the Goldsource games more than their newer counterparts. They're just more fun.",Positive

yeah..

this game is good when you can get a private game full of people, but when it comes to public stuff i'm literally unable to play it well with the awful amount of spam fake servers and anything remotely okay being laggy as hell especially compared to css. ontop of that the old cs fandom is a complete echochamber circlejerk about how anything new is horrible and how the good old days were so good and ""i wish i could go back"". i feel like so many of the people in this fandom are nostalgia obsessed has beens who can't let go of the past it's so cancerous. it's awful enough with those people on source but in the general 1.6 community it's unbearable.

I‚Äôll throw in a recipe for Chicken cutlets with mushrooms

Products
Chicken - 700 g
White bread - 50 g
Milk - 100 ml
Vegetable oil - 50 ml
Small champignons - 15 pcs.
Chicken egg - 1 pc.
Onions - 1 pc.
Garlic - 3 teeth.
Salt - to taste
Pepper - to taste


Rinse the meat, remove from the bone and cut into pieces.

Pass the prepared poultry meat through a meat grinder along with the internal fat.

Combine the minced meat with bread pre-soaked in milk. If there is no milk in the house, replace it with just water.
Add salt, ground pepper, mix thoroughly, mince again, adding peeled onion and garlic.

Pour the beaten egg into the minced meat and beat the mixture well.

Form cutlets from the prepared cutlet mass with wet hands, hiding a small whole champignon inside each one.

Fry chicken cutlets with mushrooms on both sides until golden brown.

Place the fried cutlets in a refractory dish and finish cooking in an oven preheated to 200 degrees for about 15 minutes.

Bon appetit!

10,"This game was my introduction the Counter-Strike franchise .
I still remember when I was 8 - 12 years old we had something we called in Egypt a ""Cyber"" where the public  were able to  go in and enjoy a variety of computers , there you could surf the internet , play LAN games , Multiplayer and everything you dreamed of.Anyway , there was this time , where I was going through a tough time ,because I had trouble socializing and talking with others, while my father was driving me around town,we came across a popular city cyber and he asked me if i wanted to go in and play some games until he would finish some business he had; I said ""yes"" and went in all alone as I could hear kids my and around my age laugh and have fun playing LAN games and etc, So , I quietly went into a lonely stall/booth and started a random computer where I played some games ,that I didn't really find any interest in... until , Some kid , looked a little older than me , came and asked me if I would like to join their LAN server in a game called ""Counter-Strike"", I said ""yes"" since I was happy I could finally meet new people and be a socializing kid... he took a couple of minutes connecting me and setting up the server along side some of his friends ,(I think our number was like 6) and here it was , Counter strike , my first ever map was cs_assault and oh boy was it fun, he taught me the basic fundamentals of the game ; since it was my first time I obv sucked, but nonetheless , the core gameplay, the conception and the guns ; It felt like I had finally found something I would thrive in and boil off some steam .we played for a rough hour and this hour might have been the best hour in my life , but , unfortunately , all good things must come to an end , so , after a little while , we shook hands and we left , never to see eachother again , of course , this wouldn't be the same for CS , since after a while I managed to install the game on my old computer and was able to play the game , I mostly preferred to play with bots , but , man , you had no idea how good it felt coming back after a long day of school and blasting some terrorists  with bots and playing in public community servers , I also loved zombies and gun games  and there was a time I was really good.
after a couple of years , I was still very addicted and I managed to pick myself over the ground again and manage my life . I continued to play the rest of the franchise all the way up to CS:GO in 2015 . To whoever introduced me to this franchise and taught me the mechanics that one time in that one cyber , Thank you , you are a legend.",Positive

10,"Counter-Strike 1.6, a game that revolutionized the first-person shooter genre, remains a timeless classic. Released in 2000, it built upon the success of its predecessor, Half-Life, by offering a more focused and competitive multiplayer experience.
It's a tactical first-person shooter that pits two teams against each other: terrorists and counter-terrorists. The objective is simple yet challenging: eliminate the opposing team or complete mission objectives such as bomb planting or hostage rescue. The game‚Äôs beauty lies in its simplicity, allowing players to focus on strategy, teamwork, and skill.
One of the game‚Äôs strongest points is its community. Even decades after its release, a dedicated fan base continues to play and develop mods for the game. This has kept the game fresh and exciting, with new maps, skins, and game play modes introduced regularly.
Counter-Strike 1.6 has left an indelible mark on the gaming industry. It laid the groundwork for future esports and influenced countless other games in the genre. Its competitive scene was one of the first to gain mainstream attention, and many professional players started their careers with this game.

I was playing with bots, I didn't even have speakers, but I still had so much fun. No matter how much nerves this game made me, I always came back to it. I love the Counter Strike series and always will. Counter Strike was my childhood alongside other games like GTA. I also really like Counter Strike 2, but Valve please kindly make a better Anti Cheat for this game.

This game is absolutely not noob friendly, it really throws you into the deep end. The English-speaking NA community is a whole other story. It's like one big family, everyone knows each other. Best NA servers are Clan =XA=, socalpug.com, NAS Deathmatch. If you are in EU then you also get the option of Fastcup which is essentially 1.6 Faceit.

From its engaging gameplay and strategic mechanics to the tight-knit community of friendly players, this game truly offers a unique and immersive experience. I have been playing Counter-Strike since childhood and it never fails to bring back nostalgic memories and provide endless hours of entertainment. The graphics may be a bit outdated compared to newer games, but the gameplay is where Counter-Strike truly shines. The balance between terrorists and counter-terrorists, the variety of weapons and maps, and the teamwork required to succeed all contribute to its enduring popularity. Whether you're sneaking around corners trying to outsmart your opponents or engaging in intense firefights, every match is an sexy thrill ride Long live Counter-Strike 1.6, the game that will always have a special place in my heart and the hearts of gamers around the world. Thank you for the memories, the friendships, and the endless fun. CS 1.6 forever!",Positive

but anyways, good game, you wont get lost if you play modern cs because well its the same maps and weapons like really and if you like archeology (a bunch of old russian-talking people there), you will like it even more

10,"Due to Counter-Strike 1.6 and Condition Zero being bundled together in the Steam store, the review has been divided into two parts covering both games.

Part 1: Counter-Strike 1.6
Counter-Strike is one of the most well-known and beloved multiplayer games in history. Players take on the roles of terrorists or counter-terrorists and battle for control of specific objectives. The game is renowned for its incredibly intense and thrilling gameplay that can captivate players for hours on end.

Pros:

Simple and intuitive controls
Easy to learn, Hard to master (personally a plus for me)
Large variety of maps and weapons
Dynamic and exciting esports gameplay
Cons:

Lack of a single-player campaign
Outdated graphics
Some maps are unbalanced
In summary, Counter-Strike is an excellent multiplayer game that provides many hours of intense and thrilling gameplay. While the graphics may be outdated, the simple and intuitive controls, high level of difficulty, and dynamic gameplay compensate for this inconvenience. If you're looking for a multiplayer game with a large number of maps and weapons, Counter-Strike is the perfect choice.

Part 2: Counter-Strike: Condition Zero
Counter-Strike: Condition Zero is an expansion of the iconic multiplayer game Counter-Strike (2000). The game offers new maps, weapons, and game modes, as well as a single-player campaign, which was lacking in the previous installment.

Pros:

Large number of new maps and weapons
Introduction of a single-player campaign
Game modes available in both single-player and multiplayer
Graphics and sound have been slightly improved
Cons:

Some elements of the single-player campaign are tedious
Numerous bugs and instability
Lack of significant changes in multiplayer gameplay compared to the previous installment
In summary, Counter-Strike: Condition Zero is a successful expansion of the iconic multiplayer game. The introduction of a single-player campaign and new maps and weapons are certainly a plus, but numerous bugs and instability, as well as the lack of significant changes in multiplayer gameplay, are serious drawbacks. If you're a fan of Counter-Strike, you'll surely find something for yourself in this game, but if you're a cautious player, it's worth considering other options.

10,"Farewell, CS 1.6: A Journey Beyond the Clock
A Tale of 12,000 Hours
Dear Counter-Strike 1.6, we‚Äôve shared countless hours‚Äîthe kind that stretch beyond mere gameplay. You were my refuge during late nights, my adrenaline rush when the world outside faded away. We danced through de_dust2, dodged bullets in de_inferno, and strategized in de_nuke. Those pixelated terrorists and counter-terrorists became my comrades, my rivals, my digital family.

The Golden Era
Back in 2009, you were my sanctuary. The clatter of keyboard keys, the rhythmic clicks of the mouse‚Äîeach sound etched into memory. We perfected our bunny hops, mastered the art of quickscopes, and reveled in the simplicity of your mechanics. The thrill of defusing a bomb with seconds to spare or clutching a 1v5‚Äîit was magic.

The Silence of Absence
But time moves inexorably forward. Life pulled me away from the cyber cafes, the dimly lit screens. Responsibilities, new games, and changing priorities nudged you into the recesses of nostalgia. I left you behind, like a cherished book on a dusty shelf, promising to return someday.

The Reunion: CS2 Beckons
And return I did. CS2, a phoenix rising from the ashes, awaited me. The familiar maps‚Äîde_dust, de_aztec, de_train‚Äînow bathed in modern graphics. The AK-47 felt weightier, the AWP‚Äôs scope crisper. But the heart of it all remained unchanged‚Äîthe pulse-pounding rounds, the camaraderie, the thrill of planting or defusing that bomb.

The Unspoken Connection
CS2, you whispered secrets to me. ‚ÄúRemember the headshots?‚Äù you said. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre still here.‚Äù And indeed, they were‚Äîthe same rush, the same precision. My muscle memory stirred, as if waking from a long slumber. Bunny hops? Oh yes, they‚Äôre alive and well.

The Revelation
As I stepped onto de_dust2 once more, the sun setting over the bombsite B, I realized: CS2 isn‚Äôt just a sequel. It‚Äôs a bridge across time, connecting my past to my present. The ghosts of 1.6 cheered silently, acknowledging the torchbearer.

The Bittersweet Farewell
So, dear CS 1.6, this is my farewell. You shaped my gaming soul, taught me resilience, and gifted me memories. But now, as I embrace CS2, I carry you with me‚Äîthe echoes of headshots, the adrenaline surges, the camaraderie. You‚Äôre not forgotten; you‚Äôre woven into the fabric of my gamer heart.

To New Beginnings
And to CS2: Thank you for the seamless transition, for honoring the legacy. May we continue this journey, one headshot at a time. Farewell, old friend. The clock ticks, but our memories defy its grasp.",Positive

""My beloved Counter-Strike: A Poetic Tribute"" by .jen

Roses are red, violets are blue,
Welcome to 1.6 - the only game that still holds true.
CTs are good, Ts are bad,
One wrong move, you'll surely be mad.

From Dust2's sands to Inferno's core,
From Train's whistle to Nuke's squeeky door.
CTs brace, while Ts endure,
AKs and M4s, their battles pure.

Spray and pray, the noobs may say,
But pros have skill, in every way.
Pugs and pubs, where players meet,
Only the best are called 31337.

Owned with a headshot, outplayed with finesse,
FBs and HEs, causing distress.
SGs obscure, USPs gleam,
Deagle 1 deags, a player's dream.

Glocks and Dualies, pistols in hand,
In 5v5 clashes, where victory stands.
Aces and clutches, moments of fate,
""I am the one and only,"" the last to elate.

Sharp knives slice, ""Humiliation"" with sting,
Bhopping and boosting, where skill takes wing.
Hold W and rush B, the call resounds,
C4s ticking, victory surrounds.

Wallbangs echo, through the halls,
As pros execute, their flawless calls.
Laughs and cries, fill the air,
""Fire in the hole"", players beware.

Flick shots and aims, dominating foes,
In 1.6, where legends arose.
So pick up your might, and join the fray,
In 1.6, where heroes play.

FIN

10,"[h1]POINTS TO CONSIDER BEFORE PURCHASING OR INSTALLING THIS PRODUCT.[/h1]

[h3]This is a review made after getting the 100% of the progress. [/h3]
This is where it started, despite years having passed, the game is still active with its community servers. It has excellent performance for low-end PCs so, whether because you can't play its successors due to high graphics requirements or simply because of nostalgia, Counter-Strike 1 will offer you excellent hours of entertainment.

Please don't cheat.

[h2]Positive Points:[/h2][list]
[*]VALVe.
[*]Break the gameplay cliche that many Tactical FPS games have.
[*]Excellent movement.
[*]Fun gunplay.
[*]Balanced economic system.
[*]It has a large number of maps like no other Counter-Strike has.
[*]Semi-Casual and competitive community.
[*]It doesn't have a workshop but it does have pages like ""gamebanana"" that have great content such as maps, weapon skins, player models, etc.
[*]Excellent performance for gaming on low-end PCs
[*]It has the best input lag of the entire franchise.
[/list]

[h2]Negative Points:[/h2][list]
[*]The current anti-cheating system has a lot of vulnerabilities and is very frequent to find ""bad actors"".
[*]Sometimes the community get very toxic for nothing and causes new players to end up having a bad experience.
[*]There are usually war crimes, racism, sexism, discrimination and bullying on the servers.
[*]It doesn't have a campaign mode.
[*]It doesn't have Achievements.
[*]It doesn't have a soundtrack.
[*]It doesn't have bots.
[*]Its recoil is random so it is usually uncomfortable to follow.
[*]The movement can be easily glitched to trigger exploits like bunny hopping, side walking and ground strafing.
[*]The map layout was left in the past making some maps unbalanced or frustrating compared to their updated versions in CS2.

-If so the game is fun (with friends)
-Online servers are weird (don't recommend)
-Pretty fun on touch-pad (takes at least ten hours to get used to though)(I played like 40)
-Maps you can get online are best for smaller groups
-Buy on sale otherwise don't (the game is literally older than most children)

10,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.",Positive

10,its just a cs game what did you expect,Positive
10,"Graphics: Counter-Strike 1.6 has graphics so ancient that it's like playing with pixels from the Stone Age. But hey, at least you won't need a NASA computer to run it, just a toaster will do! 

Nostalgia: CS 1.6 is like that old, worn-out pair of sneakers you just can't throw away. You know they're ugly and falling apart, but they've been with you through thick and thin. CS 2? More like a shiny new pair that gives you blisters every time you wear them.

Community: In CS 1.6, you'll find a community so tight-knit, they're practically a family. They'll welcome you with open arms, or maybe just shoot you in the face, but hey, that's how they show love! CS 2? You'll be lucky if anyone even notices you're there amidst all the flashy distractions.

Skill Ceiling: CS 1.6 separates the pros from the noobs like a sieve. Mastering bunny hopping and spraying feels like achieving enlightenment. In CS 2, you might as well just flip a coin to see who wins - it's all luck and no skill, baby!

Soundtrack: Who needs fancy EDM tracks when you can listen to the sweet, sweet melody of bullets ricocheting off walls? CS 1.6's soundtrack is like Beethoven's Symphony No. 9 compared to the dubstep mess in CS 2.",Positive

De_Dust & De_Dust 2 are my favorite maps, I still don't know how to bunny hop.  I also played this at E-cyberdeck internet cafe located at UC Irvine when I was like 13 that was the first internet cafe club I signed up for.  All of this is known & repeated data, content, & experiences. I'm trying to download it on the laptop I bought off Craigslist for $40 & doesn't play new games very well.  We'll see if it works while I refresh Job Stock at People Ready.  Best regards, Silivu",Positive

10,"The original Counter-Strike a stone-cold classic of pre-online gaming era. At least for me this title is assosiated with computer clubs, which were the only place to play CS with friends that time. And also with custom assets and new maps distributed on CDs coming with gaming magazines. This whole aesthetics has probably died because the Internet became an ordinary thing in every house. There are much more sophisticated multiplayer shooters with better balance, physics or graphics, so nostalgia is probably a key element to keep the community alive.",Positive

Review:
After spending 9.4 hours diving into the heart of Counter-Strike, it's clear why this game has stood the test of time as a pinnacle of competitive first-person shooters.

Likes:
Pure Competitive Thrill: Counter-Strike's focus on raw, competitive gameplay sets it apart. Every match feels like a high-stakes tactical chess game, requiring teamwork, strategy, and quick reflexes.

Iconic Maps: The classic maps like de_dust2 and cs_office remain not only nostalgic but also brilliantly designed. The familiarity breeds intense engagements and strategic plays.

Skill-Based Gunplay: The skill ceiling for gunplay is high, rewarding precision and mastery of weapon mechanics. The satisfaction of landing a precise shot or executing a well-timed strategy is unparalleled.

Dislikes:
Graphical Outdatedness: As expected from a game with such a rich history, the graphics are showing their age. An update to the visual presentation could enhance the overall gaming experience.

Learning Curve: For new players, Counter-Strike can be intimidating due to its steep learning curve. A more robust tutorial system could ease the entry for those new to the game.

Recommendation:
Counter-Strike remains an absolute must-play for anyone who appreciates the essence of competitive gaming. The adrenaline, the camaraderie, and the satisfaction of a well-executed plan make it a timeless masterpiece. While it may not cater to everyone due to its learning curve, those who embrace the challenge will find an FPS experience like no other.

Rating: 9/10

10," ""Counter-Strike 1.6 - A Timeless Classic That Defined an Era""
In the ever-evolving landscape of gaming, few titles stand the test of time like Counter-Strike 1.6. Released in 1999, this first-person shooter has not only shaped the gaming industry but has also become a cultural phenomenon. As I delved back into the realms of Counter-Strike 1.6, the nostalgia hit me like a wave, reminding me why this game is still revered by gamers around the globe.

One of the standout features of Counter-Strike 1.6 is its simplicity, a trait that paradoxically contributes to its enduring appeal. The game strips away unnecessary complexities, presenting a pure and straightforward multiplayer experience. Two teams, terrorists, and counter-terrorists face off in a battle of wits and reflexes across various maps. It's the quintessential formula that has captivated players for over two decades.

The iconic map design is perhaps one of Counter-Strike 1.6's greatest strengths. Dust2, Inferno, and Nuke are not just maps; they are virtual battlefields where friendships are forged, and rivalries are born. Each map is meticulously crafted to provide strategic depth, ensuring that matches are not just about raw firepower but also about intelligent decision-making and teamwork.

While the graphics may seem outdated by today's standards, Counter-Strike 1.6 compensates with its unmatched gameplay. The weapon mechanics are finely tuned, offering a satisfying blend of skill and unpredictability. Mastering the recoil patterns of each gun becomes an art form, and the sound design enhances the immersive experience, making every gunshot and footstep crucial in the heat of battle.

The community aspect is another gem within Counter-Strike 1.6. The game thrives on player interaction, creating an environment where teamwork and communication are paramount. Clan matches, LAN parties, and the birth of esports owe much to Counter-Strike 1.6, fostering a sense of camaraderie among players that transcends geographical boundaries.

It's worth noting that Counter-Strike 1.6 has aged gracefully, like a fine wine. Despite the emergence of newer titles with cutting-edge graphics and advanced features, the game's core mechanics and balance continue to attract players. Its simplicity is its strength, as it allows for easy accessibility without compromising on the depth that keeps players engaged for hours on end.

In conclusion, Counter-Strike 1.6 is more than just a game; it's a piece of gaming history. Its enduring legacy speaks volumes about its impact on the industry and the hearts of players who experienced its magic. Whether you're a veteran revisiting the past or a newcomer curious about gaming history, Counter-Strike 1.6 is a must-play that showcases the timeless brilliance of a true classic.",Positive

10,"This game is a monarch of Tactical shooters, And shooters in general. though it's graphics are outdated, it stills holds up many years later. many have heard or seen this game due to memes like the Infamous ""Door Stuck"" meme, which is now a decade and a half old. counter strike is a very famous game. I like it because of it's graphics, because I seem too like every single GoldScr graphics, but the gameplay is sorta bland. There isn't no bots, and there seems to be a lot of kids playing this. one time I heard someone who sounded like a 6 yr old laughing in his or her's mike. but eitherway, even if I do like how CSS has bots, this game holds up and would be a pick if I had nothing else. 

So Yea, I believe this game is swell. 9.7/10 ""Pretty iconic, and holds up somewhat well""",Positive

10,"Counter-Strike stands tall as a legendary FPS that redefined competitive gaming. Its iconic blend of tactical gameplay, precise gun mechanics, and strategic team-based action has been a cornerstone of the gaming community for decades.

What sets Counter-Strike apart is its simplicity and depth. The game's straightforward yet challenging gameplay, featuring bomb defusal and hostage rescue missions, demands precision and teamwork. The tight gunplay mechanics and emphasis on skill mastery create a thrilling and intensely competitive environment that rewards strategy and quick thinking.

Counter-Strike's diverse arsenal of weapons, classic maps, and community-driven content have fostered an enduring and passionate player base. Its accessibility to new players while offering a high skill ceiling for veterans has contributed to its widespread appeal across generations of gamers.

The game's evolution, from its humble beginnings as a mod to becoming a standalone title, is a testament to its lasting impact on the gaming industry. Counter-Strike remains a benchmark for multiplayer FPS games, maintaining its place as a classic that continues to captivate and inspire gamers worldwide.",Positive

10,"This is one of the best, most addicting games ever. Counter-Strike is a multiplayer-only PC game played either over a network or the Internet.

The game simulates terrorist/counter-terrorist action. You can join either the terrorist or the counter-terrorist (CT) team. The two most common scenarios are bomb defusion and hostage rescue. In bomb defusion, one terrorist is given a bomb and must plant it at a specified location. The CTs must either kill all of the terrorists prior to the planting of the bomb or defuse the bomb once it has been planted. In hostage rescue, the terrorists must prevent the CTs from rescuing the hostages.

A little background into the making of the game: Counter-Strike is a modification of Valve Software's game ""Half-Life."" Counter-Strike was not created by Valve, but by a group of people seeking to improve the multiplayer aspects of the game. It is more popular than the original game, played by millions of players all over the world.

10,"Counter-Strike, born as a Half-Life mod in 1999 and later evolving into a standalone franchise by Valve Corporation, remains a pinnacle in the world of competitive first-person shooters. With a focus on teamwork, precision, and strategic gameplay, Counter-Strike has shaped the landscape of online gaming for over two decades.

The beauty of Counter-Strike lies in its simplicity and purity of design. Divided into two teams ‚Äì Counter-Terrorists and Terrorists ‚Äì players engage in objective-based rounds that demand coordination, skill, and quick thinking. The game's emphasis on realistic weapon behavior and the absence of regenerating health add an immersive layer of challenge, creating a truly skill-driven experience.

The map design in Counter-Strike is a testament to thoughtful planning. Each map presents a unique challenge, and mastering the layouts, chokepoints, and bomb sites becomes an art form. The balance between the two factions ensures that every round is a tense battle, whether it's a hostage rescue or bomb defusal mission.

Counter-Strike's influence extends beyond its gameplay mechanics. The economic system, where successful rounds yield money for better weapons, adds a strategic layer, forcing players to make decisions that impact the entire team. This delicate balance between risk and reward is a hallmark of Counter-Strike's enduring appeal.

Over the years, Counter-Strike has seen various iterations, with each new release refining and expanding upon the formula. While the series has evolved, the core principles of precise gunplay, strategic teamwork, and a vibrant competitive scene have remained constant, proving that Counter-Strike is not just a game but a cultural phenomenon.

In conclusion, Counter-Strike's legacy is built on its unmatched ability to provide thrilling, skill-based gameplay that stands the test of time. Whether you're a seasoned veteran or a newcomer, Counter-Strike's enduring popularity attests to its status as a benchmark for competitive multiplayer shooters.",Positive

10,"The legacy of Counter-Strike is practically unrivalled: 24 years ago the original Counter-Strike Half-Life [u]mod[/u] was [i]the[/i] most-played online game in the world, with a huge competitive following. It was originally created by Minh Le and Jess Cliffe, who saw popularity to the mod sharply rise with the release of Beta 5 in 2000. This also drew the attention from Valve, who offered to buy the intellectual property along with offering the pair jobs to continue its development on GoldSrc.

Valve acquired the game‚Äôs intellectual property in 2000 and soon after released the first instalment of Counter-Strike as a standalone game for Microsoft Windows in 2000. The final, major version of Counter-Strike was released as version 1.6 on September 15, 2003. It is commonly and retroactively dubbed [i]Counter-Strike 1.6[/i] in order to distinguish it from other Counter-Strike games.

The influence of the series in mainstream game development has been massive, and easily noticeable in other franchises such as Unreal Tournament, Call of Duty and Battlefield. For over two decades we‚Äôve witnessed this franchise top the most played charts and it looks to continue with the most recent addition of Counter-Strike 2. 

But for a time, at least, we were able to enjoy the peak of competitive shooting away from loot boxes, microtransactions and in-game currency.",Positive

10,"No other game like it. You can't replace 1.6. When you look at the evolution between Source, GO, and 2, they all lead into each other in a way you could expect. 1.6 on the other hand, it's a COMPLETELY different game. No other CS has these wallbangs, this movement, this shooting, and to those that like it, you can't get this anywhere else. It takes awhile to get into it, but once you learn it, it's so rewarding and fun. GoldSrc is honestly one of my favorite game engines, I personally prefer it over the Source engine in many aspects, so for me, this is one of the best.",Positive

The game literally gives you nostalgia just by saying ""CS 1.6""
I've played this game for about 12 years (unfortunately i never had money to buy it)
I would say this game is better then CS2 not by graphics, obviously, but by mechanics, movement.
Movement is the only thing that makes this game unique in it's way. I play this game now just because i want to bhop here.
Shooting is special too. You literally don't know when you are going to 1 tap the person because the shooting is very weird. This is the thing you need to work on a lot too. Spraying is not the key in this game. You always need to go for 1 taps unless you want to die. This game gave me every emotion imaginable. I found a lot of friends in this game.
Can't let this game go anytime soon.

And I wonder if you know
What it means, what it means
And I wonder if you know
What it means, what it means
And I wonder if you know
What it means to find your dreams
I've been waiting on this my whole life
These dreams be waking me up at night (night, night)
(And I wonder) you say I think I'm never wrong (wrong, wrong)
(And I wonder) you know what, maybe you're right, aight?
And I wonder if you know
What it means, what it means
And I wonder if you know
What it means to find your dreams
word
(And I wonder) do you even remember what the issue is?
You just trying to find where the tissue is
You can still be who you wish you is
It ain't happen yet
And that's what the intuition is (and I wonder)
When you hop back in the car
Drive back to the crib
Run back to their arms
The smokescreens
The chokes and the screams
You ever wonder what it all really mean
And I wonder if you know
What it means, what it means
And I wonder if you know
What it means to find your dreams
and I'm back on my grind
A psychic read my lifeline
Told me in my lifetime
My name would help light up the Chicago skyline
And that's what I'm (and I wonder)
Seven o'clock, that's primetime
Heaven'll watch, God calling from the hotlines
Why he keep giving me hot lines?
I'm a star, how could I not shine? (And I wonder)
How many ladies in the house (if you know)
How many ladies in the house without a spouse (what it means)
Something in your blouse got me feeling so aroused (what it means)
What you about? (And I wonder)
On that independent shit (if you know)
Trade it all for a husband and some kids (what it means)
You ever wonder what it all really mean? (To find your dreams come true)
You ever wonder if you'll find your dreams",Positive

10,"Counter-Strike, originally released in 2000 as a Half-Life mod and later as a standalone game, remains a timeless classic that laid the foundation for the entire first-person shooter genre. Its straightforward yet intensely competitive gameplay has kept players coming back for more than two decades. At its core, Counter-Strike is a team-based tactical shooter that pits terrorists against counter-terrorists in a series of objective-based rounds. The gameplay is remarkably simple: eliminate the opposing team or complete mission objectives. However, this simplicity is deceptive, as Counter-Strike excels in its execution. The game's weapon mechanics are precise and unforgiving, rewarding accuracy and strategy over run-and-gun tactics. The balance of weapons and equipment adds depth to the gameplay, allowing players to develop their own styles and strategies. Every shot counts, and mastering recoil patterns becomes an essential skill. Counter-Strike's maps are iconic, offering a variety of settings and scenarios that cater to different playstyles. Whether it's a close-quarters firefight in ""Dust2"" or a tense hostage rescue in ""Office,"" each map offers a unique and challenging experience. The balance between terrorists and counter-terrorists ensures that matches are often close and competitive. One of Counter-Strike's standout features is its emphasis on teamwork and communication. Cooperation is crucial for success, and the game's lack of regenerating health or respawns heightens the tension. The need for precise coordination and strategy has made it a favorite among esports players and teams. The game's longevity is a testament to its enduring appeal. Over the years, Counter-Strike has received numerous updates and iterations, with Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) being the most recent and popular. The community has played a significant role in shaping the game's evolution through mods, maps, and custom content. However, it's important to note that the original Counter-Strike can feel dated compared to its successors in terms of graphics and user interface. The game's visuals, while serviceable, do not match the standards of modern titles. Additionally, new players may find the learning curve steep, as the game does not hold your hand and demands patience and practice to excel. In summary, Counter-Strike is a genre-defining classic that continues to be celebrated for its simplicity, competitiveness, and emphasis on teamwork. Its enduring popularity and influence on the first-person shooter genre are a testament to its quality. While it may show its age in certain aspects, Counter-Strike remains a must-play for fans of tactical shooters and competitive gaming.",Positive

1. Right click Counter-Strike

3. Click ""Betas""
4. and change none to ""Beta - Beta""

Now you can launch the game.

Alernatively, you can:

1. Download Half-Life from steam store (now free)
2. Do the same thing to get to the betas page as described above
3. Select ""Steam_legacy - Pre-25th Anniversary Build""

10,"""Counter-Strike is the game that's been with me the longest, in one form or another, but for me, it all started here. Many of the things I value most in games, I value because of Counter-Strike: good level design, team-based dynamics, the emphasis on skill, the dedication required to master it, a friendly sense of competition, and a solid sense of community. It taught me the joy of earning my victories in a game, but also the importance of learning from my failures. It's the reason I love first-person shooters and the reason I stuck by PC gaming at a young age, and I owe it all to its earliest iterations."" - IGN, 2015",Positive
10,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.",Positive

10,"I had to come back to this game, because CS:GO and CS2 were complete trash. Clunky inaccurate games that call it ""competitive"" play with handicapped players. The physics of those two games are far worse that CS:S. The Smoke clouds in CS2 take about an hour to dissipate giving terrorists an unfair advantage in the hostage maps. How is CS2 any kind of sequel to CS 1.6 CZ and CS:S? It has far less of just about everything. Garbage wall physics for shooting through material. I would've hoped they fixed the AWP BUG where you kill someone by shooting them in the foor or leg. but nope. They carried over the problems from the previous games and didn't elevate any part of the game play. Same game. Just less, with crap graphics. I don't see a big difference in graphics between CS:GO and CS2. I find the features and functions of CS:Source to be superior in every way from an interactive perspective.

Calling that new game CS2 I find offensive to its previous versions.",Positive

10,"Counter-Strike 1.6 was a significant part of my childhood. It was the first FPS game I ever played, and I first experienced it in 2005 on my oldest Steam account, which, unfortunately, I no longer use.

My memories from the days of playing Counter-Strike 1.6 are filled with joy and excitement. I recall the long nights spent gaming with friends, where we fought together in the game and forged friendships that extended far beyond the computer screen

We learned to cooperate, communicate, and trust each other to win matches. These experiences shaped my social skills and taught me the importance of teamwork.

Some of my closest friends today are the ones I met on various Counter-Strike servers. We didn't just share virtual battles but also life's joys and challenges. These friendships are precious, and I'm grateful for the memories we've created together.

Even though time has passed, and we may have lost touch, the memories of those good old Counter-Strike days will always be a part of me. It's amazing how a game could connect us and create lasting friendships that will endure a lifetime. ‚ù§Ô∏è",Positive

10,"this game is the best thing thats ever happened to me.

i love this game so much, that i would throw my computer out of the window just for it to keep existing. this game is so much better than the shitty ''Counter-Strike 2'' for way too many reasons.

the performance in this game is so good, that even some calculator made in the 1600s can run this game with nearly 0 issues. the optimization is good, unlike cs2 where you get 20 frames per a millenium. 

the community is a little toxic, but if you find the correct server with the correct 45 year old bulgarian divorced fathers then the game will be a blast for thousands or even hundreds of thousands of hours. 

this game is a blessing from god, you need to pay 10‚Ç¨ to access heaven for the entirety of your life, everything costs nothing here because custom models are completely free, and instead of paying 20‚Ç¨ for a somewhat good competitive system you can just play fastcup in 1.6(ik that faceit exists).

cheating in 1.6 is way easier than in 2, but mostly no one does it because the community isnt a bunch of retarded german 10 year old spermcells with huge skill issues, instead people play the game normally and for FUN not for RANK.

this game cures my depression, this game cures every single problem in the world that i possibly have, this game is the solution to everything.

the movement is GODLIKE, aim system is kinda ass but you just need to learn it, and most importantly,

the gamemodes like kz, zm, jl are what make this game more peak than peak can ever be. those exist in other counter strike-s aswell but they cant match 1.6.

cs 1.6 is superior to its different versions in every single way possible.

The maps themselves are cool, the Aztec one looks quite unique, and while some are more iconic and are still alive in the modern game, others seem to have been lost to time. There's still some active servers, though, so game is still alive. Although larger ones seemed to be Russian, finding an English-speaking one might be a bit harder but not impossible.",Positive
10,"Many first-person shooter games over the decades have tried to ride the wave of this banger- not one can compare. The feeling of community with all the custom maps and servers is top-notch. Even in 2023, there still exist a large swath of nostalgic people enjoying the game in custom map servers during the weekends. I was a mere child playing this game in dark netcafes and even as an adult today, shaping the choice of my professional career. I hope CS2 or the next few iterations can take hints from this gameplay, because it was fun for all of us.",Positive

10,"Counter Strike is one of the best games that Half-Life created. Although it's old and has few players compared to CS2 or CSGO, it still has the core mechanics that make the game really good. The game does many things that are better than the current modern Counter Strike like the movement mechanics and shooting. The community servers are still full with active people ready to play and have fun with you. Another really good feature that Half-Life and 1.6 had done is modding. No, it's not changing the game to have a significant advantage. It's more visual quality like importing CSGO knifes to the game or having anime characters as your skin rather than the boring Leet models. All in all, for a game that is technically in it's extinction period, people should still continue to play CS 1.6 since the game never gets old and is better than CS2 or current CS full of cheaters and improper bugs.",Positive
10,"Once upon a time, in the early days of PC gaming, a small group of modders had a crazy idea. They believed in a world where terrorists and counter-terrorists could engage in a battle of wits, reflexes, and all the gunfire you could handle, without leaving the safety of your desk chair. And so, in the late '90s, they gave birth to a phenomenon we now know as Counter-Strike.

The game was, in a way, like your grandma's famous stew - a little bit of this, a dash of that, and a whole lot of secret sauce. It was pure magic, wrapped in pixelated graphics and the occasional ""I can't believe you just shot me!"" rage. But it was love at first sight for many. You could choose to be a terrorist or a counter-terrorist, wielding all sorts of weapons and striving to complete objectives or eliminate the enemy team.

As the years went by, Counter-Strike evolved, much like your teenage years - it got a little smarter, a bit more mature, and much better at killing terrorists and defusing bombs. There were new maps, new weapons, and, of course, endless arguments about which gun was the best (spoiler: it was always the AWP). It was a mix of strategy, teamwork, and, well, a fair amount of camping in dark corners.

But it was in 2012 when things got a bit more ""Global."" Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, or CS:GO, burst onto the scene. It was like Counter-Strike had put on a fancy suit, polished its shoes, and gotten a promotion. CS:GO brought better graphics, improved gameplay mechanics, and more matchmaking options. The esports scene exploded, turning the game into a major league of its own. It was like the Super Bowl for gamers, but with fewer commercials and more headshots.

Yet, as time went on, CS:GO started showing its age, like that old sitcom you used to binge-watch in your pajamas. Fans clamored for something new, something fresh, something with a ""2"" at the end of it. And Valve, the brilliant minds behind Counter-Strike, heard their pleas. Thus, Counter-Strike 2 was born.

The sequel took everything we loved about CS:GO, sprinkled in some futuristic tech, and voil√†! It was as if the old dog had learned some new tricks. The graphics were out of this world, and the gameplay was smoother than a jazz solo. But, at its core, it remained the Counter-Strike we all knew and loved.

With the release of Counter-Strike 2, CS:GO was officially retired, a hero riding into the sunset, leaving behind an indelible legacy in the gaming world. It was a bittersweet moment for fans, like saying goodbye to an old friend. But as they loaded up Counter-Strike 2 and heard that familiar ""dun dun dun dun"" of the menu music, they knew the journey was far from over. Counter-Strike was here to stay, evolving and adapting, just like the gamers who loved it.

So, whether you're a seasoned veteran or a fresh-faced recruit in the world of Counter-Strike, remember that this game isn't just about shooting terrorists and defusing bombs. It's about friendships forged in the heat of battle, memories made in the dust of de_dust2, and countless hours spent wondering why the guy on your team insists on buying a Negev every round. Here's to Counter-Strike, past, present, and future - a game that keeps on giving, just like a good stew recipe that's passed down through the generations.",Positive

My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.",Positive

10,"I want to bring to your attention that there are people attempting to scam you out of your Steam points. The following comment is a copy-and-paste from multiple reviews on Steam. These individuals use this tactic to manipulate you into giving them Steam points, using appeals to your compassion, but in reality, it is all lies and deceit.

""I am a 52 year old father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my son, who is now 16. My son recently started Dinkum and in less than a week, he had already played for over 20 hours. This was terrible for me, as it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching videos on Tiktok. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, did the tutorial but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought my son and I closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.""

Please help spread the word by liking this review so that more people can become aware of this issue. Thank you.",Positive

10,"Counter-Strike 1.6, released over two decades ago, remains a timeless classic in the world of first-person shooters. This iconic game has left an indelible mark on the gaming industry, and its popularity endures to this day. As someone who has spent countless hours in the world of Counter-Strike, I can confidently say that this game continues to offer an unparalleled gaming experience.

Gameplay (5/5):
The core gameplay of Counter-Strike 1.6 is as captivating as ever. It strikes a perfect balance between strategy and skill, requiring players to work together as a team to complete objectives or eliminate the opposing team. The simple yet effective mechanics of buying weapons and equipment at the start of each round, along with the intense gunplay and precise aiming, make every match an adrenaline-pumping experience.

Maps (4/5):
Counter-Strike 1.6 features a roster of iconic maps that have become synonymous with the franchise. Maps like Dust2, Inferno, and Nuke have stood the test of time and continue to provide intense and engaging battlegrounds. While the graphics may be dated by today's standards, the map design is still top-notch, offering a variety of strategic options and memorable chokepoints.

Graphics (3/5):
Let's be honest, Counter-Strike 1.6's graphics have not aged gracefully. The game was released in an era when polygon counts and texture resolutions were limited by hardware constraints. However, it's essential to consider that this game was revolutionary in its time. Despite its outdated graphics, the gameplay and mechanics are so compelling that you'll quickly overlook the visual shortcomings.

Community and Modding (5/5):
One of the most remarkable aspects of Counter-Strike 1.6 is its thriving community and modding scene. The game's longevity can be attributed in part to the dedicated player base that continues to create custom maps, game modes, and server plugins. Whether you want to engage in classic bomb defusal matches or try out fun mods like Zombie Escape or Surf, the community has something for everyone.

Nostalgia Factor (5/5):
For many players, Counter-Strike 1.6 holds a special place in their hearts. It's a game that has brought friends together, sparked fierce rivalries, and left lasting memories. The nostalgia associated with this title is a significant part of its enduring appeal.

Conclusion:
Counter-Strike 1.6 may not boast the modern graphics and features of its successors, but it remains a must-play for any fan of competitive first-person shooters. Its gameplay, community, and nostalgia factor combine to create an experience that stands the test of time. Whether you're a veteran revisiting your roots or a newcomer curious about the history of FPS gaming, Counter-Strike 1.6 is a classic that still holds its own.",Positive

10,"I am recommending this because of nostalgia. If you are someone who has never played counter-strike 1.6, I would have a tough time recommending this unless you want to check out where counter-strike got its roots from. There are some things in this game that are somewhat anti-competitive like crouch walking (some may call it silent-stepping, groundstrafing, g-stafing), quick-switching to reload faster, boosting people through roofs, the insane amount of wall bangs you can do. Some do raise the skill cap. Where this game shined for me was the modding community and the custom game modes. This is where kz started, where surfing started, where scoutzknivez started, bhopping was around before counter-strike but counter-strike had bhop communities as well. This is where weapon skins came from as modders would make custom models for weapons and custom player models. This and counter-strike: condition zero are the only counter-strike games to have a competitive knifing community because the knife mechanics were changed in other versions of counter-strike which made knifing non-competitive. You could get a headshot with a knife; how could you not like that! The graphics are definitely dated by today‚Äôs standards and high fps with a high refresh rate monitor does not feel as smooth as in most modern fps games. Counter-strike has always been one of the best game series for the cost compared to what you get because of the communities and mods that sprung up around it. Counter-strike does not have a built-in matchmaking ladder like csgo. This is the game that really accelerated the esports industry. There has been so much esports history made in counter-strike. The reason why steam was created in the first place was to give people a more efficient way of updating their games and a way to implement a cheating protection know as Valve Anti-Cheat with counter-strike being the main focus. This game reminds you just how good you had it when you were a kid and not many games can rival the impact counter-strike has had on the esports and gaming industry.",Positive

I remember being so scared of multiplayer games and the fact that if I would just hit ""escape"" to pause the game and it wouldn't work just scared me at the time. I was so scared of playing multiplayer to the point where I had told my mom that I was proud of what I've done that day and from that day on, I started liking playing both mp and sp. This game is one of the grandfathers of FPS gaming and a model after which lots of FPS operate, play and take shape because of how iconic and how perfect of a textbook example it is for the FPS genre.",Positive

10,"This is where it all started. Memories of my childhood started with just playing a cracked version of Counter Strike 1.6 and Flash Games. Still using Windows XP at the time, the internet was really slow, and you couldn't really do much on a PC besides playing the games that game with it. You would be lucky to find more games in the Hard Drive. This was also the time where YouTube was at its infancy, I would remember watching a lot of ""Stick Figure on Crack"" videos. I would always remember the time where things were just perfect. It was a simpler time back then. And now here I am, finally purchased an official copy of Counter Strike 1.6, and the nostalgia was still there. A very timeless, evergreen game that have already imprinted on my memories as one of the best that ever happened during my entire life. I would like to thank for the existence of this simple FPS shooter game that started it all, alongside Need for Speed: Underground, DDR, and Warcraft III.",Positive

What are you going to have to deal with when trying to play it in the present?  Most of the people you play with are going to be Hispanic or Russian, the servers are going to be modded to feature music, strange skins, parachutes and other weird shit.  Every server is its own community in a way, which also means that if you piss off the wrong person you'll probably end up banned.

10,"I recently had the opportunity to dive into the gaming history by playing Counter-Strike 1.6, and let me tell you, it's an absolute classic that still holds up incredibly well today.

Gameplay (‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ):
Counter-Strike 1.6 is renowned for its addictive gameplay, and it's easy to see why. The blend of teamwork, strategy, and skill required to succeed is truly unparalleled. The moment you join a match, the adrenaline starts pumping, and every round feels like a new challenge. The simple yet effective mechanics make it accessible for both new players and veterans. The thrill of defusing a bomb or clutching a round is unlike anything else in the gaming world.

Graphics and Sound (‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜ):
Given that this game was released in 1999, it's no surprise that the graphics are a bit dated. However, there's a certain charm to the pixelated character models and low-res textures. It's like stepping into a time machine and experiencing the roots of modern FPS gaming. The sound design, on the other hand, is timeless. The gun sounds and footsteps are still some of the most iconic in gaming history, adding to the overall immersion.

Community (‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ):
The Counter-Strike 1.6 community is something truly special. Despite its age, there are still dedicated servers and players worldwide. I was pleasantly surprised to find a welcoming and helpful community of gamers willing to teach newcomers the ropes. It's a testament to the enduring appeal of this game that people are still so passionate about it.

Nostalgia Factor (‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ):
For someone like me who didn't grow up playing Counter-Strike, there's a certain nostalgia factor that's hard to ignore. It's a trip back in time to the golden era of PC gaming. Even though I didn't experience it when it first released, I can appreciate its historical significance and how it laid the groundwork for the modern esports scene.

Conclusion:
Counter-Strike 1.6 might not have the flashy graphics or features of today's shooters, but it doesn't need them. Its gameplay and sense of camaraderie within the community are timeless. It's a reminder of what made competitive gaming so compelling in the first place. If you haven't played it yet, I highly recommend giving Counter-Strike 1.6 a shot. It's a classic gem that has rightfully earned its place in the gaming hall of fame.",Positive

10,"Counter-Strike is a Half-Life mod where you are put on a team of either terrorists or counter-terrorists. Each team has to work together to achieve a certain objective or eliminate the opposing team, whichever happens first. The unique feature is that you are given money at the start of each round to buy weapons, armor, and other useful equipment. There are multiple game modes and maps.

The problem I have with this game is that I bought it twenty-three years too late. First of all, there are no tutorials or instruction booklets that come with this game (at least on Steam). You have to read guides made by other players like I did if you want to know even just the pure basics of gameplay. It helps to have experience with other GoldSrc (the Half-Life engine) games too. After you find a server near you that uses your language (English language servers in the United States are not as common as you might think), you'll most likely be stuck playing on the most popular map forever: [b]de_dust2[/b] (a desert map where you either have to deploy a bomb as terrorists or prevent the bomb from being deployed as counter-terrorists). So, if you wanted to play the other game modes or maps, good luck on your search. Anyways, if you're a noob to the game like me, you're going to be wrecked. There are many skills that need to be learned in order to become a decent player. These range from the various types of ""hopping"" to ""wallbangs"" AKA shooting players through walls - which I am still not sure is fair...

Despite all these struggles for new players, the game is still what it needs to be: fun! It's easy to start playing right away, and that's one of the benefits to not having a tutorial. In just a few clicks, you're playing a match with people that have been doing it for over twenty years. The servers I played on didn't have terrible people either - just the standard FPS trash talk you'd expect. I could play this game for a long time and get better at it, but I simply don't care enough to do that. My proudest moment? Getting two frags at the same time.

10,"Al-Qaeda (/√¶lÀàka…™d…ô, Àå√¶lk…ëÀêÀàiÀêd…ô/; Arabic: ÿßŸÑŸÇÿßÿπÿØÿ©, romanized: al-QƒÅ øida, lit.‚Äâ'the Base', IPA: [√¶lq…ëÀê ï…™d…ê]) is a pan-Islamist militant organization led by Sunni Jihadists who self-identify as a vanguard spearheading a global Islamist revolution to unite the Muslim world under a supra-national Islamic state known as the Caliphate.[79][80] Its members are mostly composed of Arabs, but also include people from other ethnic groups.[81] Al-Qaeda has mounted attacks on civilian, economic and military targets of the US and its allies; such as the 1998 US embassy bombings, the USS Cole bombing and the September 11 attacks. The organization is designated as a terrorist group by NATO, UN Security Council, the European Union, and various countries around the world.

The organization was founded in a series of meetings held in Peshawar during 1988, attended by Abdullah Azzam, Osama bin Laden, Muhammad Atef, Ayman al-Zawahiri and other veterans of the Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War.[82] Building upon the networks of Maktab al-Khidamat, the founding members decided to create an organization named ""Al-Qaeda"" to serve as a ""vanguard"" for jihad.[82][83] When Saddam Hussein invaded and occupied Kuwait in 1990, bin Laden offered to support Saudi Arabia by sending his Mujahideen fighters. His offer was rebuffed by the Saudi government, which instead sought the aid of the United States. The stationing of U.S. troops in Arabian Peninsula prompted bin Laden to declare a jihad against the Saudi Arabian rulers, whom he denounced as murtadd (apostates), and against the US. During 1992‚Äì1996, Al-Qaeda established its headquarters in Sudan until it was expelled in 1996. It shifted its base to the Taliban-ruled Afghanistan and later expanded to other parts of the world, primarily in the Middle East and South Asia. In 1996 and 1998, bin Laden issued two fatƒÅwƒÅ that demanded the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Saudi Arabia.

In 1998, Al-Qaeda conducted the US embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania, which killed 224 people. The U.S. retaliated by launching Operation Infinite Reach, against al-Qaeda targets in Afghanistan and Sudan. In 2001, Al-Qaeda carried out the September 11 attacks, resulting in nearly 3,000 deaths, long-term health consequences of nearby residents, damaging global economic markets, triggering drastic geo-political changes as well as generating profound cultural influence across the world. The U.S. launched the war on terror in response and invaded Afghanistan to depose the Taliban and destroy al-Qaeda. In 2003, a U.S.-led coalition invaded Iraq, overthrowing the Ba'athist regime which they falsely accused of having ties with al-Qaeda. In 2004, al-Qaeda launched its Iraqi regional branch. After pursuing him for almost a decade, the U.S. military killed bin Laden in Pakistan in May 2011.",Positive

10,"[h1] ""CS 1.6: An Elegy to Timeless Brilliance"" [/h1]

In the realm of gaming, where trends and innovations often shift like the sands of a digital hourglass, Counter Strike 1.6 stands as an enduring masterpiece, its brilliance transcending the constraints of time itself. This virtual symphony of strategy and camaraderie, devoid of the visual grandeur that modern gaming flaunts, is a resounding testament to the profound notion that true artistry lies not in the grandeur of graphics, but in the depth of experience.

As I navigate the pixelated landscapes of Counter Strike 1.6, an overwhelming tide of nostalgia washes over me, carrying me back to days when pixels were both our limitations and our canvas. Every footstep, every bullet fired, carries with it the echoes of bygone moments, reminding me that the passage of years cannot erode the significance of the memories forged within this digital arena. The game is more than a series of levels and objectives; it's a portal to our personal histories, a lens through which we relive our youthful fervor and unbridled excitement.

For more than two decades, Counter Strike 1.6 has wielded its banner as the paragon of shooter games, an archetype by which others are measured, and a cornerstone of the gaming universe. Its gameplay mechanics, while seemingly simplistic in comparison to today's sensory spectacles, remain a testament to the axiom that complexity isn't the sole purveyor of greatness. The mastery lies in how it distills the essence of competition, skill, and teamwork into a concoction that's as potent now as it was two decades ago.

In an era when a cavalcade of polygons and lifelike textures often takes center stage, Counter Strike 1.6 emerges as a powerful reminder that true artistry transcends pixels and polygons. Its austere aesthetics merely provide a backdrop for a symphony of strategy and camaraderie that resonates on a higher plane. This game is a rebuke to the notion that visual splendor is a prerequisite for greatness, a testament to the irrefutable truth that a game's worth is measured in the heartbeats it quickens, the friendships it forges, and the memories it bequeaths.

Counter Strike 1.6 doesn't just defy the ephemeral nature of gaming trends; it shatters it. As I stand on the virtual precipice, gazing at the same pixelated landscapes that captivated me years ago, I am struck by the realization that a masterpiece is not confined to an era. It's an entity that transcends its own creation, an artwork that defies the eroding touch of time, and a testament to the immutable bond between player and game.

So, as I load up Counter Strike 1.6 and embark on another virtual odyssey, I do so with a heart full of nostalgia, a mind attuned to the timeless mechanics, and a soul humbled by the knowledge that true brilliance remains unswayed by the shifting tides of technological progress. This is not just a game; it's an ethereal journey, a celebration of enduring camaraderie, and a reminder that pixels and polygons are mere vessels, while the true legacy is etched in the indelible memories of those who dared to embrace its brilliance.",Positive

10,"Remember the good ol' days when internet speed was measured in kilobits and not even your grandma knew what a ""frag"" was? Well, step into the time machine and welcome to Counter-Strike 1.6, the game that taught us that camping wasn't just for summer vacations.

Back in the day, we waited longer for our dial-up connection than for a round to start. But oh, the sweet satisfaction of that headshot after patiently lining up your pixels! You could practically hear the 'thwack' of the CRT monitor when you hit your mark.

The graphics were so pixelated, you'd think the terrorists were trying to plant a bomb made out of Minecraft blocks. And don't even get me started on the hitboxes ‚Äì they were as wonky as your grandma's antique radio.

Tactical gameplay? Nah, we preferred the ""spray and pray"" approach. Who needs strategy when you can just throw a smoke grenade and rush in with a Mac-10, hoping your dial-up didn't crash midway?

Remember de_dust2? That iconic map could fit in your pocket now, but back then, it was our universe. We knew every nook, cranny, and sneaky camping spot like the back of our oversized, trackball mice.

So, if you're feeling nostalgic for the days when LAN parties were a thing, when your mom yelled at you for hogging the phone line, and when a headset meant something you wore at an air traffic control tower ‚Äì fire up CS 1.6, because those were the times when gaming was as simple and chaotic as your favorite family reunion.",Positive

[b]Rating: ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ (5/5)[/b]

Counter-Strike 1.6 stands as a testament to the enduring allure of a game that has not only shaped an entire genre but also left an indelible mark on the gaming landscape. As one of the most iconic first-person shooters ever created, CS 1.6 has captivated players for decades with its strategic gameplay, intense action, and community-driven spirit.

From the moment you enter the gritty world of Counter-Strike 1.6, you're immediately immersed in a heart-pounding experience that demands tactical prowess and quick reflexes. The game's mechanics are elegantly simple yet incredibly deep, fostering a gameplay loop that is easy to learn but difficult to master. The balance between counter-terrorists and terrorists, each with distinct objectives and weaponry, keeps matches engaging and varied.

Graphically, Counter-Strike 1.6 might show its age compared to modern titles, but its charm lies in its straightforward visual design. The simplicity of the maps and character models contributes to the game's accessibility, allowing players to focus solely on gameplay without distractions. Plus, its low system requirements mean that even today, a wide range of players can enjoy the thrill of CS 1.6 on various hardware setups.

What truly sets Counter-Strike 1.6 apart is its vibrant and tight-knit community. The game's popularity has led to a dedicated player base that continues to host servers, create mods, and organize tournaments. The sense of camaraderie within the community is palpable, making CS 1.6 not just a game but a shared experience that transcends time.

The core gameplay modes, such as bomb defusal and hostage rescue, offer a level of tension that few other games can match. Every round is a high-stakes battle of wits, where cooperation, communication, and individual skill intertwine to create moments of pure exhilaration. While newer iterations of the Counter-Strike series have introduced refinements and innovations, CS 1.6 remains the purest embodiment of the franchise's essence.

In conclusion, Counter-Strike 1.6 is an absolute masterpiece that has stood the test of time. Its simple yet profound mechanics, combined with its passionate community, make it an experience that transcends generations. Even in the face of modern gaming advancements, CS 1.6 continues to remind us why classic games hold an irreplaceable space in the hearts of gamers. Whether you're a long-time fan or a curious newcomer, stepping into the world of Counter-Strike 1.6 is a journey well worth taking.",Positive

Imagine life without me, it's a waste of time
You want the kind of love that can make a child
Don't want just anybody (not just anybody, not just anybody)
Ooh
Good love fills my body up like a glass
When you pour it all out
If you know me, you know I mind
Someone like me is hard to find
Not mistaken if I'm there
Well aware you are always mine
And still you seem so surprised
Always gon' be mine
I wanna be where you are
I just can't walk away
You drive me crazy, ah
I lose it, lose it
And I wanna be where you are
I just can't walk away
You drive me crazy, ah
I lose it, lose it
Imagine me
Circlin' through life without a piece of you
Seven out of seven days I'm needin' you
You brin' life to the party
Good love feels like butterflies suffocatin' your insides
Oh, it's a late night, you know I try
I cannot picture when you ride
I'm mistaken thinkin' you were taken
Knownin' now, you were always mine
And still I feel so surprised
You're always gon' be mine
Rarely ever missin', talk is cheap and time is tickin'
Rarely ever trickin', catch me slippin', I put you on leakin'
I'm on mission, payin' millions, I'm Ted DiBiase (God)
Out late night, I'm sinnin', still a Christian, don't tell my Deacon
I mean pastor, oil her down, not talkin' castor
Ridin' 'round with six-seven bitches with no tint, you can see I'm pimpin'
Big four-five on my hip, look like I'm limpin', never simpin'
One of my cousins Crippin', always grippin', shit get dangerous
Always keep it player, we can swap out hoes, I'm never trippin'
Only love my mother, my sister, my daughter
All these hoes get slaughtered
They can't be mine, pray to the holy father",Positive

This game gives you lot of opportunities to play. There are lot of game mods, fun servers and even more!

I starts playing this game as a NonSteam player in 2011 and as a Steam Player in 2012.

This game make my life more better! My first programming experience was with this game. As a Pawner. And now programming is my fulltime job.

Thanks Valve for amazing ChildHood and lot of beutiful memories!

Maybe we need to make it popular again, because this game is still good and playable.

I Understand that people not playing this game anymore because this game is to old, and there is so many competitors such as Valorant, CS:GO, COD, etc.

But, this game is actually better then all the FPS game, for me ofc, i don't know about the others. It's because you don't need high spec, even in low spec this game still playable, and i love how to server things go, like we can choose any room, i mean that's cool.

one last thing about the game is, the game doesn't have ""Matchmaking"", i mean such thing like ""Queue Match"".

I hope Valve give us some update, but anyways, thank you CS :)",Positive

This game gives you lot of opportunities to play. There are lot of game mods, fun servers and even more!

I starts playing this game as a NonSteam player in 2011 and as a Steam Player in 2012.

This game make my life more better! My first programming experience was with this game. As a Pawner. And now programming is my fulltime job.

Thanks Valve for amazing ChildHood and lot of beutiful memories!

10,"Simple game as simple were the times when I used to sink days into it. Sure, non-steam, but hey at least can do this to pay little tribute,
I thought I can't get into CS:GO because I already burnt myself out on the game in my youth but while it still holds true I've noticed that this old game is much more satisfying to just pop in and play a little. Not sure is it the nostalgia or perhaps simple fact that you only open up the game, pick a server and just play...that's it, no strings attached, no crazy menus attacking you, skins, sales offers...it's just pure in a sense. Although it may be funny to speak of purity while community servers live out of being at the very least mid-modded with custom music, prompts, gameplay tweak etc. But hey it only makes it more enjoyable in my opinion. It's very much like different game modes as whatever mod is being run on a server it will get downloaded while joining, no external input required.
In the end it's an old and simple fun, no tryhard ranked queues, skins, no FOMO...like damn as if I just played a game...but if that's so then what are we typically ""playing"" these days?

10,"Counter-Strike 1.6 holds a special place in the hearts of many gamers, and for good reason. Even after all these years, it remains an iconic and timeless first-person shooter that continues to captivate players with its addictive gameplay, intense competition, and strong community.

First and foremost, the gameplay mechanics of Counter-Strike 1.6 are nothing short of exceptional. It strikes the perfect balance between tactical depth and accessibility, making it easy for newcomers to jump in and learn the basics while providing a high skill ceiling that rewards dedicated players. The tight gunplay, realistic weapon handling, and emphasis on teamwork create an exhilarating and strategic experience that has stood the test of time.

One of the defining features of Counter-Strike 1.6 is its vibrant and dedicated community. Even years after its release, you can still find active servers bustling with players from around the world. This thriving community ensures that you'll always find opponents to test your skills against, and the competitive nature of the game fosters a sense of camaraderie and teamwork that few other titles can match.

The map design in Counter-Strike 1.6 is a masterclass in level creation. From the iconic Dust and Dust 2 to the tense and claustrophobic corridors of Nuke, each map is meticulously crafted to offer a unique gameplay experience. The strategic chokepoints, hiding spots, and various routes create a dynamic and ever-evolving battlefield, ensuring that no two matches play out the same way.

Counter-Strike 1.6 also excels in its weapon balance. Each firearm has its own distinct characteristics and serves a specific purpose, encouraging players to experiment with different loadouts and find their preferred playstyle. The game's economy system adds an additional layer of strategy, as managing your resources and making smart purchasing decisions can often be the key to victory.

Furthermore, Counter-Strike 1.6's longevity can be attributed in part to its modding community. The game supports an extensive array of mods, including custom maps, game modes, and player-created content. This constant influx of fresh content ensures that there's always something new and exciting to discover, providing endless hours of entertainment beyond the core gameplay.

Visually, Counter-Strike 1.6 may show its age compared to modern titles, but its art direction and distinctive aesthetic have a charm of their own. The simplicity of the graphics allows for smooth performance even on lower-end systems, ensuring a consistent and enjoyable experience for a wide range of players.

In conclusion, Counter-Strike 1.6 remains an undisputed classic in the first-person shooter genre. Its addictive gameplay, skill-based mechanics, and strong community have cemented its place in gaming history. Whether you're a longtime fan or a newcomer eager to experience the roots of competitive shooters, Counter-Strike 1.6 is an absolute must-play. It's a testament to the enduring brilliance of a game that has brought joy and excitement to countless players worldwide for over two decades.",Positive

10,"I'm a 40-year-old father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game.

I am a single dad to my son, who is now 10 years old. My son recently started playing CS.
In less than a week he has already played over 8 hours.

It was awful for me because it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son.
Because he was always with his friends or watching YouTube videos.

So I decided to create a Steam account to play with my son. I started playing, but it was my first time playing a video game since the 90s, so I was pretty lost. I asked my son for help and we spent a few hours playing the game together.
I enjoyed it, as it was the best time I had with my son since my wife died. Playing video games reminded me that there is fun in everything, and it brought me and my son back together, and now we actually spend time together outside of the house.",Positive

Thanks for making this wonderful game. I know now you are moved to CS-GO. But that's graphics savvy game. And just for fun and strategy CS 1.6 is still at same level in amusement.
I will still re-buy this game in double or may be triple the price of CS-GO.

My humble request is to develop this game for Macbook M1/M2 (Arm64 in general) chips. Anyway after sometime Windows Arm64 will dominate the world.

10,"Counter-Strike, available on Steam, is a legendary multiplayer first-person shooter that has left an indelible mark on the gaming landscape. Developed by Valve Corporation, this timeless title has captured the hearts of players worldwide for its strategic gameplay, intense firefights, and dedicated community. Whether you're a veteran of the series or a newcomer, Counter-Strike offers an adrenaline-pumping experience that continues to stand the test of time.

One of the standout features of Counter-Strike is its emphasis on tactical teamwork and precise gunplay. The game divides players into two teams: terrorists and counter-terrorists, each with distinct objectives. Coordination, communication, and strategic planning are essential for success. The game rewards players who master map knowledge, utilize effective strategies, and showcase skillful aim. The competitive nature of Counter-Strike fosters an immersive and rewarding experience that keeps players coming back for more.

The gunplay in Counter-Strike is exceptionally well-crafted. Each weapon feels distinct, with realistic handling and mechanics. Mastering recoil patterns, understanding weapon behavior, and honing your accuracy become essential for achieving victory. The balance between the various weapon options ensures that no single strategy or loadout dominates the gameplay, promoting diverse playstyles and strategic decision-making.

Counter-Strike's map design is a testament to its excellence. From classic maps like Dust II and Nuke to the wide range of community-created maps available, there's a rich variety to cater to different playstyles and strategies. The layouts are intricately crafted, offering multiple paths, chokepoints, and opportunities for tactical maneuvers. Map knowledge and understanding player dynamics are crucial for gaining the upper hand in engagements, making each round a thrilling and dynamic experience.

The game's longevity can be attributed to its dedicated community and active competitive scene. Counter-Strike boasts a passionate player base that continues to refine their skills, create custom content, and compete in tournaments at both amateur and professional levels. The competitive matchmaking system ensures balanced and challenging matches, fostering a sense of progression and achievement.

Counter-Strike's accessibility is another strength. The game can run on a wide range of systems, allowing players with varying hardware capabilities to participate. It also offers various gameplay modes, including casual matches, competitive ranked play, and community-created mods. This flexibility ensures that players of all skill levels and preferences can find an enjoyable and engaging experience within Counter-Strike.

It's important to note that the learning curve of Counter-Strike can be steep, particularly for newcomers to the series or the first-person shooter genre. The game's emphasis on skill, map knowledge, and teamwork may initially present a challenge. However, with practice and perseverance, the sense of accomplishment derived from mastering the game's mechanics is immensely satisfying.

In conclusion, Counter-Strike stands tall as an iconic multiplayer shooter that has left an undeniable legacy. Its strategic gameplay, precise gunplay, and vibrant community have solidified its position as a staple in the gaming world.

I am a single father for my son who is now 10 years old. My son recently started playing CS 1.6.

In less than a week, he has already played more than 20 hours.

It was terrible for me, because it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son.
because he was always with his friends or watching YouTube videos.

So I decided to create a Steam account to play with my son. I started playing but it was my first time playing a video game since the 90s so I was pretty lost. I asked my son for help and we spent several hours together playing this game.

I liked it as it was the best time I have had with my son since my wife died. Playing video games reminded me that there is fun in everything and it brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside of the house.",Positive

10,"Counter-Strike: A Competitive FPS Masterpiece

Counter-Strike is an exceptional first-person shooter (FPS) game that has captured the hearts of millions of players worldwide since its inception. Developed by Valve Corporation, Counter-Strike offers an intense and strategic gameplay experience that is hard to match. In this review, we will explore the key elements that make Counter-Strike a unique and captivating game.

One of the defining features of Counter-Strike is its emphasis on teamwork and tactical gameplay. Unlike many other FPS games, Counter-Strike requires players to work together as a team to achieve objectives. Communication and coordination are vital, as players must strategize, plan their movements, and execute precise manoeuvre‚Äôs to outsmart their opponents. The depth of teamwork and strategy in Counter-Strike sets it apart from other games in the genre.

Another standout aspect of Counter-Strike is its realistic and balanced weapon mechanics. The game offers a wide array of weapons, each with its own characteristics and handling. From pistols to sniper rifles, every weapon has its purpose and requires skillful handling to master. Additionally, Counter-Strike's recoil system adds a layer of authenticity, making it essential for players to learn to control their shots. The weapon mechanics in Counter-Strike contribute to the game's skill-based gameplay, rewarding precision and accuracy.

Counter-Strike's competitive scene is another factor that makes it truly exceptional. The game has become a staple in the world of eSports, with professional tournaments drawing in massive audiences and offering substantial prize pools. The highly competitive nature of Counter-Strike pushes players to constantly improve their skills, leading to a vibrant and dedicated community. The thrill of competing against skilled opponents and the prospect of climbing the ranks adds an addictive element to the game.

Furthermore, Counter-Strike boasts a remarkable map design that enhances gameplay diversity. Each map is meticulously crafted, offering a unique layout and distinct tactical possibilities. Whether it's navigating tight corridors in close-quarters combat or strategically positioning oneself for long-range engagements, the maps in Counter-Strike provide endless opportunities for creative strategies and memorable moments. The constant updates and addition of new maps by the developers ensure that the game remains fresh and exciting.

In terms of graphics and audio design, Counter-Strike strikes a balance between visual appeal and performance optimization. While the game may not have the most cutting-edge graphics compared to newer titles, it maintains a clean and timeless aesthetic that doesn't distract from the core gameplay. The sound design, on the other hand, is exceptional, with distinct audio cues that help players locate enemies and plan their next move.

In conclusion, Counter-Strike is a true gem in the FPS genre, offering a thrilling and strategic gameplay experience. Its focus on teamwork, balanced weapon mechanics, competitive scene, map design, and solid audio design set it apart from its competitors. Counter-Strike has stood the test of time and continues to captivate players with its addictive gameplay and vibrant community. Whether you are a seasoned player or new to the game, Counter-Strike is a must-play for anyone seeking an exhilarating and challenging FPS experience.

After a time I found out, there are a lot of other ways to play that game.
I started to play Deathrun, KZ (Kreedz) and HNS (Hide & Seek).
That helped me a lot because now in 2023 I have a very good movement in CS:GO.

Counter-Strike 1.6 

offers a unique online experience with intense, fast-paced multiplayer gameplay. The game puts two opposing teams against each other in an effort to eliminate one another. Players can choose from a variety of weapons and work together in order to complete objectives and outmaneuver the opposing force.

10,"Counter-Strike - The Game That Defined a Generation of Shooters!

Counter-Strike is an iconic first-person shooter that has left an indelible mark on the gaming industry. As a fan of the series since its inception, I can confidently say that the original Counter-Strike is a game that has stood the test of time and remains a benchmark for multiplayer shooters.

One of the most notable aspects of Counter-Strike is its simplicity. The game pits terrorists against counter-terrorists in intense rounds of tactical gameplay. With limited resources and no respawns, every decision matters. The gameplay is fast-paced, strategic, and incredibly rewarding. The combination of teamwork, skill, and communication required to succeed is what sets Counter-Strike apart from other shooters.

The arsenal of weapons in Counter-Strike is iconic, from the trusty AK-47 to the precise AWP sniper rifle. Each weapon has its unique characteristics, and mastering their use requires practice and skill. The balance of weapons and their realistic recoil patterns add depth to the gameplay, making for thrilling gunfights and satisfying kills.

The maps in Counter-Strike are legendary, with names like Dust, Inferno, and Nuke etched into gaming history. Each map has its own layout, chokepoints, and strategic spots, making for dynamic and ever-changing gameplay. The level design encourages teamwork, communication, and strategic planning, creating a unique and immersive experience with every match.

Counter-Strike's multiplayer community is one of its greatest strengths. The game has fostered a passionate and dedicated player base that spans across the globe. Playing with friends or jumping into a server with strangers, the camaraderie and competitive spirit of the Counter-Strike community are palpable. The game has also spawned a vibrant esports scene, with professional players and tournaments that continue to captivate audiences worldwide.

The graphics and sound in the original Counter-Strike may not be as flashy or realistic as modern games, but they are functional and effective. The focus is on gameplay and mechanics, and Counter-Strike delivers in spades. The game has a timeless appeal that transcends graphics and remains a testament to the power of gameplay and mechanics.

In conclusion, Counter-Strike is a game that has left an indelible mark on the gaming world. Its addictive gameplay, iconic weapons and maps, and vibrant multiplayer community have made it a classic that has stood the test of time. If you're a fan of first-person shooters or looking to experience a game that has defined a generation of shooters, Counter-Strike is a must-play. 5/5 - ""A Legendary Classic That Never Gets Old!",Positive

10,"Counter-Strike...May, or may not be the best online multi-player FPS game ever created...until loot boxes were invented. which is like the equivalent of the 2008 stock market crash, but in the world of Video Games.

 Of course I would still recommend it to people, since it's a prime example that you don't need a massive game development team with endless resources and money to create a timeless classic. Just an idea and a solid community who are dedicated to what they do for the love of the game....although I'm sure having a state of the art dev team, a private yacht to code on, with a helicopter landing pad. (And a dedicated fiber internet connection ran under the ocean floor to connect to your 1-of-1 Router with a 200, CAT-11 ports that support your 10 Peta-bytes Per second (PBPS) download/upload speed, and the best attorneys money (Bitcoin) can buy.... probably doesn't hurt either. üòé

 I miss the days of  dropping the files (audio, sprites, skin, etc in corresponding CS sub folders) for a new weapon skin downloaded from a website from extremely talented individuals, as opposed to spending more money on a knife skin than you would on an IRL luxury car.",Positive

10,"I started playing Counter Strike 1.5 before the release of Steam, and I was instantly hooked. I spent countless hours playing on Dutch server Public Enemy and I made some great friends there. When Counter Strike 1.6 was released, I was excited to see the improvements and new features. The game kept me entertained for hours on end, and I loved the competitive aspect of it. Even after all these years, I still enjoy playing it occasionally and it brings back a lot of nostalgia. It's amazing to see how the game has evolved over the years, but I'll always have a special place in my heart for the classic version of Counter Strike.",Positive

10,My bat9 like this game so much,Positive
10,"-(Only played CSGO before this)-(play consoles primarily so maybe i just suck)-(potato internet)-(usually run 0-10 deaths and 15+kills playing other MP games)-(ran 25-40 deaths and 10-20 kills in the 3 matches i played this) - Some of the spawns are complete garbage. The spreads on guns are ridiculous even after analyzing recoil patterns and burst firing. Too many variables to consider when it comes to firefights, that aren't explained at all, to even know if it was your fault you died or if you just got hit by lag. This is one of those games im sure runs flawless over LAN or with an optimal internet connection but is really frustrating(because its impossible to tell if its a user error) to get through when your aiming at an enemies head, fire, and the bullet goes completely off course(unless its a sniper). Considering range and the weapon, at optimal range the second bullet in a burst could be an inch off to 5ft away from where you were aiming. When playing this i feel like a nerd with no upper body strength or cardio who always misses leg day thrown into a battlefield with little to no experience even though i have fired multiple weapons in real life. Feels like a bit too much is up to luck to fully enjoy but i do like how chaotic it is and thats enough to keep me coming back for a random MP match here or there. Servers are very active for a game with this age. With all that said i haven't played a ""traditional"" hostage match yet just TDM and FFA but everything feels surprisingly slow and inaccurate, when im not immediately dying, which may work for sloower, traditional, more strategic based modes where you have the time and space to react in a controlled manner while coordinating with other team mates but feels like im carrying a sack of potatoes while trying to smoke a blunt playing TDM and FFA. I must hone the irish/russian stoner in me to git gud",Positive

10,"Counter-Strike is an objective-based, multiplayer tactical first-person shooter. Two opposing teams‚Äîthe Terrorists and the Counter Terrorists‚Äîcompete in game modes to complete objectives, such as securing a location to plant or defuse a bomb and rescuing or guarding hostages. At the end of each round, players are rewarded based on their individual performance with in-game currency to spend on more powerful weapons in subsequent rounds. Winning rounds results in more money than losing and completing objectives such as killing enemy players gives cash bonuses. Uncooperative actions, such as killing teammates, results in a penalty.
Originally a modification for Half-Life, the rights to Counter-Strike, as well as the developers working on it, were acquired by Valve in 2000.
The game received a port to Xbox in 2003. It was also ported to OS X and Linux in the form of a beta in January 2013. A full release was published in April 2013.
Counter-Strike is considered one of the most influential first person shooters in history. The series has a large competitive community and has become synonymous with first person shooters. As of August 2011, the Counter-Strike franchise has sold over 25 million units.

10,"I don't even know where to begin with this review.

My Steam account will be celebrating it's 19th year this November (2024) and I'm feeling very nostalgic so I thought I would put a review that really showed how much I deeply care about this game and the impact it had on my life. 

The year was 2005... I was a freshman in high school and met some new friends that turned me onto Counter-Strike right when Source and HL2 were releasing. I couldn't afford a computer that could run any of the HL2 games so I had to go with 1.6 and BOY was that one of the better decisions I made at that time. $30 for a physical combo of 1.6 and Condition Zero at Circuit City. At first I was put off by how hard it was to control recoil but still enjoyed the challenge and was not interested in the competitive aspects (yet) until I discovered... FUNMAPS!

While 1.6 stock maps such as Dust2, Inferno and Train were all beautiful in their own way, nothing could have prepared me for user generated funmaps. Servers loaded to capacity with endless custom made content that felt like you were playing an almost entirely different game the way some were created. Server sizes as large as 32 players full with people all laughing and joking over voice chat enjoying the nonsensical yet so creative level design. To me, Counter-Strike was THE pioneer for funmaps and user generated content. No other game engine in my opinion (aside from Source) could match the Half-Life goldsource aesthetic. It was truly such a huge honor to be a part of witnessing map launches from the Cherry Clan and filming the iconic LUE Funmaps videos. Memories I will never forget. Including some of the friends I met and still talk with to this very day. 

While it may never truly be the same as it was back then it's surprising to see such healthy numbers still playing this today. I often look back fondly at all the hours (time tracking before Steam was on X-Fire) I put into this. I owe this game for my curiosity in game development and modding given the accessibility was and always has been free to use. 

CS2 is really cool and inspiring to see where the technology is going but I can't help but hope that one day more people will catch on to Funmaps and look beyond the hyper competitive business model Valve is pushing and try a funmap or two.",Positive

Let me tell you, Counter-Strike may be old, but it's like a fine wine. It only gets better with age. The graphics may be outdated, but the gameplay is still top-notch. The guns may not have fancy skins, but they still pack a punch. And don't even get me started on the maps. Dust 2? More like ""Dust Too Good""!

But let's talk about CS:GO for a second. Sure, it's got better graphics and fancy skins, but what's the deal with all these newfangled weapons? What's next, a grenade launcher? Come on, now. And don't even get me started on the microtransactions. I don't want to have to take out a second mortgage on my house just to get a cool skin for my AK-47.

In conclusion, Counter-Strike may be old, but it's still got it where it counts. And CS:GO? Well, let's just say it's like that younger brother who's always trying too hard to be cool. Stick to what you know, kid.",Positive

10,"As someone who has played Counter-Strike 1.6, I can say that it is an absolute classic in the world of first-person shooters. The game has stood the test of time, and continues to be one of the most enjoyable and challenging multiplayer experiences available.

One of the things I appreciated most about the game was its simplicity. Unlike many modern shooters, Counter-Strike 1.6 keeps things straightforward and focused on the core gameplay elements that make the game so enjoyable. The controls are intuitive and easy to master, making it accessible to players of all skill levels.

The game's community is also one of its greatest strengths. Players from around the world come together to compete and cooperate, and the game's simple but effective communication tools allow players to work together effectively. This creates a sense of camaraderie and competition that is hard to find in other games.

The game also has a high level of replayability. The various game modes and maps, combined with the unpredictable nature of multiplayer gameplay, mean that no two matches are ever exactly the same. This keeps the game fresh and exciting, even after many hours of play.

Overall, I cannot recommend Counter-Strike 1.6 highly enough. Whether you're a seasoned veteran of the franchise or a newcomer to first-person shooters, this game is sure to provide you with an enjoyable and challenging experience. It truly is a classic that every gamer should experience.

10,"I am a 55 yo mother, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single mother to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2022 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my husband had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.

10,Greatest classic of them all,Positive
10,"Ultimate classic that still holds up today.

Counter-Strike (1.6) is an all-time classic and one of the first games that I owned and played on my Steam account. I even bought it boxed and with that, started my journey on Steam.

Counter-Strike is a simple, yet so fun, game. You choose a team, in which your objectives vary. You can play as terrorists or Counter-terrorists. As terrorists, you keep and defend hostages, place bombs at specific sites and prevent the counter-terrorists from defusing them. As counter-terrorists, you try to save the hostages and defuse the bombs that terrorist have placed. 

Meanwhile, you pump each other full of lead. I especially liked the VIP mode, in which one player is appointed as a target that will win the round if eliminated. The other players on your team need to defend you with their lives until the time is up to win. It is a unique and fun experience that was most fun at LAN parties.

When starting the round, you choose/buy your weapons. You can choose a variety of pistols, sub-machine guns, heavy assault rifles, sniper rifles and grenades. Some weapons work better for you than others, so half the fun is trying to figure out which weapon has the right feeling and handling for you. The weapons themselves however, are well balanced and I did not experience any unfair advantages with a specific weapon.

The Graphics in Counter-Strike are really nice for the time. They are well rendered and textured, and the frame rate is spot on. No tearing, no lag, it runs smooth as butter. The animations are stiff and when killed, you drop dead as a brick, but this the charm that the game has.

In terms of sound, this game nails it, especially for the time period. Guns sound aggressive and loud, and explosions can be felt through your headset. It is spot on and holds up great with today‚Äôs standards.

The controls are easy to learn and work fluent and responsive.

My only problem at the time with Counter-Strike was the limited time to choose your gear before the round starts. It is completely logical that players do not wait until everyone choose their shiny guns, but when first playing, I was still checking what weapon would be best for me, and before I knew it, I had forty holes in me. But, like with many other First Person Shooters, especially online, I just need to git gut.  

I still cherish the memories of this game at the many LAN parties I attended to, the pure joy, tension and competitive game play that had this unique experience back then. The thrill when you finally blow someone up with a well lobbed grenade, the satisfaction when you finally sent a successful sniper bullet through someone‚Äôs skull, it was just amazing. Counter-Strike will always be one of my favorite online shooters today. 

The upgraded Counter-Strike: Source introduces new graphics and an even smoother experience, however, Counter-Strike (1.6) will always remain an all-time gem that can be played any time. When I am feeling old, I just play this version over the Source remake or Global Offensive, just for good old times. 

Definitely recommend this timeless relic.",Positive

This game was every competitive players dream back in high school days. But caleague was so corrupted, so many players were cheating, then cal made their own anti-cheat, then that anti-cheat turned out to be complete garbage. Admin giving crap judgement, for example: A player is cheating in a match instead of over turning the match he gives a warning. (Of course Valve had nothing to do with caleague and cevo, caleague and CEVO was there for players to enjoy the competitive side of the game, but that didn't go the way it was intended.)(Basically all third parties who were providing competitive play.)

Some of the so called friends that were on my friends-list took my name and removed me from their friends-list and a few months later I'm getting asked, ""Hey weren't you on such-and such team with some guys harassing females."" I'm like, ""what the hell is this guy talking about."" Weird stuff was going on.

CEVO was also another corrupted league, They banned Alan in cs:go when Alan invited me to play with him in one season.

In cs:go a player named Maestro, asked me to play with him in the Main Division, so he tells me to pay for my spot (which was ten dollars.) and be ready for the season. The season comes and he literally removed me from the roster without letting me know, there was no communication on what was going on, but there was other players on the roster that I didn't know.

To much backstabbing in leagues.

2/1/2023

ESEA at some point, they changed every inactive member to have a 1 at there name, turns out someone was impersonating as me and they actually let it happen. A few months later they changed everyone's name back to normal except mine.

But the funny thing is a person named Ryan Thorns-ton(not sure how the last name was spelled) but he and Jacobson was on a team together for placement and then invite, somewhere there something happened. And the team broke up, Then we are hearing that Ryan died in a car crash, few years down the road then shroud on his twitch stream, (by the way twitch stopped content creators from keeping there videos for some odd reason, so you won't find it.) saying that Ryan is still around, (no not freakazoid.) So it had me thinking like, wait a minute didn't they say he died in a car crash?

But I would like to talk to Ryan and ask him what happened cause apparently I was being called a cheater from a few other players that knew a CAL-I player and I know I haven't cheated. The CAL-Invite team was Confederacy and the tag was Co",Positive

10,"This game saved my life.

I am 27.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you",Positive

10,"Counter-Strike 1.6 Review üéÆüí•

Counter-Strike 1.6, one of the most iconic FPS games ever, remains a classic even after two decades. Whether you're a casual player or a hardcore gamer, CS 1.6 has carved out a place in gaming history. Let's dive into why this game has such legendary status!

Gameplay üïπÔ∏è
CS 1.6 offers simple but intense team-based action. Players join either the Terrorists üí£ or Counter-Terrorists üëÆ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è, with the primary objective to either plant the bomb or defuse it (depending on your team). There‚Äôs also a hostage rescue mode ü§ù, which adds extra variety to the missions.

What makes CS 1.6 so engaging is its high skill ceiling. From learning the maps üó∫Ô∏è to perfecting your aim üéØ, there's always something to improve. Movement and shooting require mastery, and the rush of landing a perfect headshot üíÄ never gets old.

Graphics üé®
Okay, let‚Äôs be honest: by today‚Äôs standards, the graphics are dated ‚è≥. However, for its time (early 2000s), CS 1.6‚Äôs visuals were sharp and functional. The textures may look blocky üß±, but the simplicity helped keep the focus on pure skill and gameplay.

Besides, the nostalgia factor ‚ù§Ô∏è plays a huge part here. Many players grew up with these visuals, and the blocky environments are part of the charm.

Maps and Weapons üõ†Ô∏è
Maps like de_dust2 and de_inferno are legendary and still used in modern tournaments. The layouts are balanced and require strategic team play. Whether it's finding the perfect camping spot üèïÔ∏è or rushing to plant the bomb, the map design is top-notch.

Weapons range from pistols to machine guns üî´, each with its own recoil patterns and tactics. The AK-47 and M4A1 are favorites, but don‚Äôt underestimate the power of the AWP sniper rifle for long-range domination üî≠.

Community and Mods üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë
One of the key reasons CS 1.6 has stayed relevant is the community. Players have created countless mods, maps, and skins üé®, keeping the game fresh even today. From zombie mods üßü to custom servers, the flexibility in user-created content makes the game infinitely replayable.

Also, playing with friends or on public servers is a unique experience, full of surprises and fun moments üòÑ.

Competitive Scene üèÜ
CS 1.6 practically invented the esports FPS scene. While the game has been replaced by Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS
) in major tournaments, 1.6 still has a dedicated following and its own local tournaments ü•á. Watching or playing in a competitive match feels intense and strategic‚Äîwhere every bullet counts.

Conclusion ‚≠ê
Even after all these years, Counter-Strike 1.6 is a testament to what makes a game truly great: simple mechanics, an engaging community, and skill-based gameplay. Whether you're returning for nostalgia or discovering it for the first time, CS 1.6 still packs a punch. üéØüí•

Final Verdict: Timeless classic that shaped the FPS genre üïπÔ∏èüî•.",Positive

10,"This game saved my life.

I am 41.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with... The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.",Positive

10,"How is it simultaneously more difficult but also easier than CS:GO?
No clue but it's fun.  Steam says I have 78 hours but I had hundreds on an old disc installation and I love this game",Positive
10,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.",Positive

Each time he died in 1.6, he ALT+TAB'd the game and went on to play online casino slots till he respawned.

He did this during lessons where there were computers. 

If you think that's something special - no, that's just how the Russian speaking population of Eastern European countries acted during 00s - early to mid 10s. 

I do like this better than CS:GO though lol",Positive

10,"Counter-Strike (CS) is a series of multiplayer first-person shooter video games, in which teams of terrorists battle to perpetrate an act of terror (bombing, hostage-taking, assassination) and counter-terrorists try to prevent it (bomb defusal, hostage rescue). The series began on Windows in 1999 with the first game, Counter-Strike. It was initially released as a modification (""mod"") for Half-Life and designed by Minh ""Gooseman"" Le and Jess ""Cliffe"" Cliffe before the rights to the game's intellectual property were acquired by Valve Corporation, the developers of Half-Life.

That original game was followed by Counter-Strike: Condition Zero, developed by Turtle Rock Studios and released in 2004. In November of that year, Counter-Strike: Source was released by Valve. Released eight months after Condition Zero, Source was a remake of the original Counter-Strike and the first in the series to run on Valve's newly created Source engine.[1] The fourth game in the main series, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, was released by Valve in 2012 for Windows, OS X, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3. Hidden Path Entertainment, who worked on Counter-Strike: Source post-release, helped to develop the game alongside Valve.[2]

There have been several community-made spin-off titles created over the years. These include the Online series, Neo, and Nexon: Zombies.",Positive

What it means to find your dreams
I've been waiting on this my whole life
These dreams be waking me up at night (night, night)
(And I wonder) you say I think I'm never wrong (wrong, wrong)
(And I wonder) you know what, maybe you're right, aight?
And I wonder if you know
What it means, what it means
And I wonder if you know
What it means to find your dreams
word
(And I wonder) do you even remember what the issue is?
You just trying to find where the tissue is
You can still be who you wish you is
It ain't happen yet
And that's what the intuition is (and I wonder)
When you hop back in the car
Drive back to the crib
Run back to their arms
The smokescreens
The chokes and the screams
You ever wonder what it all really mean
And I wonder if you know
What it means, what it means
And I wonder if you know
What it means to find your dreams
and I'm back on my grind
A psychic read my lifeline
Told me in my lifetime
My name would help light up the Chicago skyline
And that's what I'm (and I wonder)
Seven o'clock, that's primetime
Heaven'll watch, God calling from the hotlines
Why he keep giving me hot lines?
I'm a star, how could I not shine? (And I wonder)
How many ladies in the house (if you know)
How many ladies in the house without a spouse (what it means)
Something in your blouse got me feeling so aroused (what it means)
What you about? (And I wonder)
On that independent shit (if you know)
Trade it all for a husband and some kids (what it means)
You ever wonder what it all really mean? (To find your dreams come true)
You ever wonder if you'll find your dreams",Positive

10,"I live in the American Gardens building on West 81st Street, on the 11th floor.
My name is Patrick Bateman.
I'm 27 years old.

I believe in taking care of myself, in a balanced diet, in a rigorous exercise routine.
In the morning, if my face is a little puffy, I'll put on an icepack while doing my stomach crunches.
I can do a thousand now.
After I remove the icepack, I use a deep-pore cleanser lotion.
In the shower, I use a water-activated gel cleanser.
Then a honey-almond bodyscrub.
And on the face, an exfoliating gel-scrub.
Then I apply an herb mint facial masque,
which I leave on for ten minutes while I prepare the rest of my routine.
I always use an aftershave lotion with little or no alcohol,
because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look older.
Then moisturizer, then an anti-aging eye balm, followed by a final moisturizing protective lotion.

There is an idea of a Patrick Bateman.
Some kind of abstraction, but there is no real me.
Only an entity-- something illusory.
And though I can hide my cold gaze...
and you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping yours...
and maybe you can even sense our life styles are probably comparable,
I simply am not there.",Positive

10,"My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn.
Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a ""hit"" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is.",Positive

10,"Ironic when you buy the original from the money you made selling cases in GO.

Also whats the point with oldsrc if its even more inconsistent to bhop than in the latest installment. 
I had the impression this was made before competition and case unboxing stole the spotlight from fun and replayable gameplay.
Oh well, atleast the weapons sound better.",Positive

10,"Counter-Strike: Ok, after 9 years of unlimited fun with friends, I have finally quit counter strike. Counter strike, in all of its versions, its just a great FPS game that anyone can enjoy it. Its a great game and all, you just cant stop playing it, you can just sit and play with your friends for days with out stoping. The huge weaoponary option you can choose and the smooth and sound of the game, its just f*cking addicting. With this games I've met so many different people and unique friends. This game is literally G(OLD). To all the young players who are looking for a good cheep and fun game to play with their friends, I highlly recommend on this. I've got (with steam record) 2,484hrs record in counter strike IN TOTTAL,,, and who knows how many more hrs in a non official steam version of this game.... Great Game. GG WP.
And too all the people who will keep playing this game, all I can say, as always, GL & HF <4",Positive

Cons: 
All the servers are: spanish, 
shitty csgo remodels, 
everytime you die music plays, 
all the normal servers are died or have 900 ping,
no bot support unless you download some programs. So your stuck with 24/7 dust 2 csgo model servers, 
have to buy ammo ;-;

10,"- How I rate this game -
This game is pretty good. But the Steam version request Bots because I like the classic games but... why only mutliplayer? I like playing hostage, defuse the bomb, base builder, zombie mode and zombie escape modes and porting some maps for fun but I can only play alone.

- Updates -
This game is not dead allready because there are some players in the servers, but the game needs some updates like bring back Prison mode, bots for steam version or add workshop to the game than looking at the sites with viruses in the maps. What If there will be more weapons or there will be mods in the workshop or bot radio sounds for the players like ( I got blinded! ) than ( Cover me! ) and some graphic changes.

- Glitches -
Can valve fix the glitch with oilrig map because I played nonsteam version of the Counter-Strike to play with bots but... when the bot was the VIP, the VIP doesn't wanted go to the helicopter and glitched infront the stairs.

- The End -
The reason why I'm making this because I want to make this game better than the old one and nonsteam version. There are no more things that I want to say so bye.",Positive

You boot into one and some foreign version of merry christmas starts playing with some Eminem song playing over it, and then you enjoy your crazy deathmatch, kz map, or zombie survival thing or whatever.

The players here are surprisingly way less racist than GO players, and so helpful too. Made some really unexpecting friends from only 3 hours of gameplay.

10,"[b]If you are looking for a review of this game you have come to the wrong place but, instead here I have some interesting Banana facts that you will most certainly appreciate![/b]

[b]Fact Number 1.  [/b]
[i]A banana is a berry not a fruit. This is because botanically a berry contains seeds inside the flesh, not outside.[/i]

[b]Fact Number 2. [/b]
[i]Banana does not grow on a tree but on an herb. A tree‚Äôs stem is made of wood unlike the banana‚Äôs, which is made of fibers.[/i]

[b]Fact Number 3.  [/b]
[i]Bananas are sterile; you can‚Äôt sow seeds and grow them. Bananas are grown by cutting a piece from another plant, sort of cloning. Which means the banana you are eating today is genetically the same as the banana your grandfather ate.[/i]

[b]Fact Number 4.  [/b]
[i]Bananas have been cultivated for the past 10,000 years or so in Southeast Asia. From there it moved to West Asia and Africa.[/i]

[b]Fact Number 5.  [/b]
[i]In all likelihood bananas were first cultivated not as food but as source of fibers that were treated and made into cloth.[/i]

[b]Fact Number 6. [/b]
[i]Portuguese colonizers introduced bananas to the Americas. However, Europeans should thank French writer Jules Verne for introducing them to the fruit. Verne was ecstatic about bananas in his book Around the World in Eighty Days.[/i]

[b]Fact Number 7.  [/b]
[i]Bananas are radioactive! They contain small amounts of the isotope potassium-40. But for the radiation to be harmful you need to eat close to 700 bananas daily for over 80 years.[/i]

[b]Fact Number 8.  [/b]
[i]Bananas are in fact good for you. It fights depression, cures headaches and helps in weight-loss. Banana skins are used to treat insect bites. Bananas are rich in vitamin C, anti-oxidants, calcium and folic acid.[/i]

[b]Fact Number 9.  [/b]
[i]The term banana republic‚Äô was coined to describe Central American countries that depended on one single export (bananas) and were controlled by foreign businesses (in this case American). These countries were usually run by corrupt dictators.[/i]

[b]Fact Number 10.  [/b]
[i]The popular dessert banana split was invented in 1904 by a 23-year-old American pharmacist David Evans Strickler in Pennsylvania.[/i]",Positive

10,"Steam says 48 mins playing, but I know the real number is higher. I remember a time of days gone by, I would pump in insane hours per day, just to get rank 1 of a server I played (Blueyonder server before it became virgin and closed) ..... But still steam says only 48mins, a measly 48mins. When Valve upgraded to Steam, they closed the old hosting on WoN servers, and my rank gone with it.... all those hours gone. And this is from a time before, before you kids all had global stats. Oldskool gamers didnt even have stats on one single server, that was years and a few scripts away. We were literally playing online for fun, other Humans were a gimmick at the time u'see. Not even a medal, pfft",Positive
10,"Does the pope shit in his hat?

I don't know if he shits in his own hat, but he's shit in mine quite a few times. I don't know how or why he does it, but at least a couple times a year, I'll be in my apartment by myself, just living my life, and all of a sudden I'll hear this loud moan followed by giggling and an absolutely horrific smell. At this point I know it's him once I hear the moan, so I get up to try to catch him, but before I can, he's already in the front doorway giving me this stupid smirk. I always try to reach out and grab him, but he just winks and runs off to the Popemobile idling outside.

Just to be clear, I live in Chicago, not the Vatican, and as far as I can tell, he's coming out here just to shit in my hat. There are no big news stories about him visiting or anything like that, but there is a page in an official Vatican site that shows his travel schedule and it always says he had to make a brief visit for ""holy administrative purposes"". It's also worth noting that he's in full the full Pope outfit when he does this, so it's pretty impressive that he can move as fast as he does, especially considering his age.",Positive

10,"This game saved my life.

I am 5.

My e-wife and I have a e-daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my e-kids e-mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are e-parents, and e-friends.

I now have 3 e-kids. My third e-child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The e-woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been e-dating for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you",Positive

10,"Been playing for more than 20 years now, (despite what steam says), and it's still a great experience if you can find an alright server to play on. Mind you - this isn't CSGO with worse graphics, so don't expect that. Players move differently, weapons shoot differently, et cetera. CS 1.6 is more individual oriented whereas CSGO is more of a team game. One big difference you'll notice is, people play this game to have fun. If you lose, no big deal. There's no ranks. No rising in ranks. No dropping in ranks. You're just here to have fun. And that's okay.

But what the hell am I writing this for? Is there anyone out there who hasn't played this game? I just wanted to leave a good review.",Positive

10,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.",Positive

10,The game that started it all.,Positive
10,"I am 32 years old.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand‚Äîthe hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed‚Äîthe hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you.",Positive

10,"This game is good, but not as good as my cinnamon bread!

What you'll need:

- A 9x13 Pan (preferably glass)
- Non Stick Spray
- 2 Tubes of Biscuits (Pillsbury or Otherwise)
- 1 and 1/2 sticks of Salted Butter (Unsalted also works, just be sure to add a 1/2 teaspoon of salt in step 3)
- 4 Teaspoons of Brown Sugar
- 1 Teaspoon of Cinnamon
- 1 Tablespoon of Honey
- 2 Tablespoons of Milk, Heavy Cream, or Buttermilk (Non-Dairy Milks work as well. See Step for more info) (More as Needed)
- 2 Cups of Powdered Sugar (more as needed)

Step 1. Preheat your oven to 350 and give your pan a light coat of non-stick spray

Step 2. POP THEM BISCUITS OPEN BABY!!

Once you get the biscuits out, grab a butterknife (or use your hands you filthy animal) and quarter them. Start laying em out in the pan. Spaces in-between the biscuits is A-okay cause we want that buttersugar to get down in there once we start pouring. Likely, you'll run into the issue of ""too many biscuit pieces, not enough space"" so just kinda squish em down and try to fill in the edges and corners with an extra biscuit piece. Once you've got all the biscuits packed in there, we're on to step 3!

Step 3. BUTTERSUGAR TIME

Grab your 1 and 1/2 Sticks of butter and we're gon' melt that son of a gun. Personally, I like to melt butter in the microwave, but if you wanna get all fancy and pull out the saucepan then go for it. Ain't nobody stopping you.

So for the rest of us common folk, put your butter in a microwave safe bowl or Pyrex measuring cup. I throw it in there for like 1min and just check on it closer to the minute mark, but we all got different microwaves. Basically, you just want the butter to be melted with no chunks left in it. So however long it takes to do that. DON'T leave it in too long or it'll burn and then you gotta go get more butter.

NOW. You've got your melted butter. Add the Cinnamon and the brown sugar to it and stir the everliving life outta that thing til' it's all nice and pretty. Once you've successfully crafted the buttersugar, pour it over the biscuits in the pan. My two main goals here are ""1. Make sure every biscuit gets some love"" and ""2. Fill in all the cracks"" So pour slow and steady.

Step 4. MAKE IT HOT

Okay. Let me level with you here. I am not a classically trained baking professional. I'm just a regular schmegular person who likes the sweety sweets. I have ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• these up before and this is the step that made my spouse leave.

Double check the oven is on 350. Put the little biscuits in the oven so that they can grow up to be big and strong. Leave them in there for about 10-13min. Be sure to check on your biscuits throughout the process. What you're looking for is the tops to be golden brown. Like that real fresh baked brown, that you see in the movies and tv and recipe sites. Once you see golden brown, open the oven and don't be afraid to get a little greedy. Grab a biscuit off the top so you can see how the middle section and bottom of the pan look.

If it looks doughy Turn the oven off and let the biscuits sit inside for maybe 5 minutes. Again, note the color of the tops and go back to your reference piece that you took out. You want them to look like done biscuits. I can't put pictures but I'll make a guide if people are interested and go back through all the steps with pictures.

If it doesn't look doughy Well then what the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• are you doing? Move on to the next step champ! We got biscuits to eat!

Step 5. Make the Glaze

In a good sized bowl, whisk together your Powdered sugar, honey, and milk. If you don't have a whisk, that's fine. Just go grab a utensil or something. Personal preference: Fork. They look meaner than the other utensils.

NON-DAIRY MILK USERS UNITE!
I really like an almond milk substitute here, but whatever works, works. Just know, with the amount of ingredients we're using here, your glaze may come out thin and runny. If it does, don't panic and cry. Just add a little more powdered sugar in tablespoon increments. Add, whisk and repeat if it still comes out runny. Once it's thick enough, go ahead on.

Take your whisked mixture and and drizzle it over the finished biscuits. And boom done. You just baked something delicious.

If you read this far, thank you. If you liked the recipe, thank you. I'll try to make a guide and go back through with pictures and gifs to make this a lot easier to follow if enough people want that.

Call the ones you love, tell em you love them.

Let me know what recipe you want me to do next.",Positive

10,"Met the most beautiful person here, good experience and community is really nice most of the time. Older players were usually really nice to younger newcomers to the game and that is really satisfying.  When there was the cheating thing I never really bothered that much. The only thing I dislike is that you cant zoom with your weapon. This game relays a lot on single play performance and that is not something I like too much.
Not saying that the game is focused on performance of an individual but I always had feeling of a burden playing counter strike series most of the time being deadweight or the last person in the scoreboard which I never really hated. Never played source that much but overall very good experience. I never understood the aiming still to this day. Favorite weapon obviously M4. People on servers hated me for shield playstyle, BEST DAYS gg. The nickname even tho if I remember correctly the guys that gave me even said I should change it a little. Thanks for the times with the girl early in my childhood growing up.",Positive

10,"My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn.
Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a ""hit"" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is",Positive

10,"My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn.
Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a ""hit"" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is.",Positive

10,"While at first glance this game may look old, it hasn't aged at all. This game feels the exact same as it did back in 2005. I can honestly say that this game has stood the test of time better than any other game I can think of. This is the king of all competitive FPS games. It may have been dethroned when CS:GO was released in 2012, but this game will never truly die. Even if the day comes when there are zero servers, this game will still be alive. It will be alive in the hearts and souls of all of those players who have had the joy of discovering and playing this game over the last 19 years and counting. Even today in North America, you can find competitive pick up games - sure, it might be with people who don't speak your language, and some people may cheat or leave early, but it's doable. And if you happen to live in Europe, there is still an active competitive community over there. There aren't many players left, but there are players, and this game is an absolute gem. I would recommend this game even today, due to the extremely high quality, and most of all, fair mechanics this game offers.",Positive

10,Game can be fun depending on what group of sexy boomers you get the cranky unmarried ones get tilted really fast if you are better and start kicking you and banning you from their servers and than the married one's who are funny as heck unfortunately got stuff to do plus there's less of them so overall the servers are a bit unplayable. But still the CS i know as i got called Tranny and the N word multiple times plus got a few dox and death threats by some older dudes which was kinda hot.

10,"I am a 14 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 3 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game,  I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories",Positive

10,"I am recommending this because of nostalgia. If you are someone who has never played counter-strike 1.6, I would have a tough time recommending this unless you want to check out where counter-strike got its roots from. There are some things in this game that are somewhat anti-competitive like crouch walking (some may call it silent-stepping, groundstrafing, g-stafing), quick-switching to reload faster, boosting people through roofs, the insane amount of wall bangs you can do. Some do raise the skill cap. Where this game shined for me was the modding community and the custom game modes. This is where kz started, where surfing started, where scoutzknivez started, bhopping was around before counter-strike but counter-strike had bhop communities as well. This is where weapon skins came from as modders would make custom models for weapons and custom player models. This and counter-strike: condition zero are the only counter-strike games to have a competitive knifing community because the knife mechanics were changed in other versions of counter-strike which made knifing non-competitive. You could get a headshot with a knife; how could you not like that! The graphics are definitely dated by today‚Äôs standards and high fps with a high refresh rate monitor does not feel as smooth as in most modern fps games. Counter-strike has always been one of the best game series for the cost compared to what you get because of the communities and mods that sprung up around it. Counter-strike does not have a built-in matchmaking ladder like csgo. This is the game that really accelerated the esports industry. There has been so much esports history made in counter-strike. The reason why steam was created in the first place was to give people a more efficient way of updating their games and a way to implement a cheating protection know as Valve Anti-Cheat with counter-strike being the main focus.",Positive

10,"CS is one of the greatest and undermined games in history. It is, in my opinion, the best

game to ever have a crosshair. It is not a contact sport, so for the girly girls, it is an activity to indulge in.

It starts off with a team trying to kill another team.

CS is unique among the games because it teaches all of us that no matter where we are in life, there is a role for us to play, and we can help our fellow man by fulfilling that role, and thereby our destiny. What destiny might you ask? I spoke before of unity. And it is that unity that brings us all together like one big loving family. That is the nature of counter-strike; the many working as one. One machine made of well oiled cogs and wheels, moving in unison, happy to play their part in the production of something greater than themselves. Not that these small metal objects are actually animate, I'm of course speaking only metaphorically.
ver the course of the years, I have increased in skill, but I have learned a greater lesson than how to be a better cs player. I have learned how to cooperate with a team to accomplish a goal that we all share. Even if that team is less than ideal. I have realized that cs is about more than just one's athletic ability. Instead, there is a deeper meaning behind the colt, the AK, the AWP, the deagle, the sands under my feet (in d2 or inferno). And more importantly, the teammates at my side. I love them. It is the human element of cs that gives cs its greatness.

In conclusion, I love cs. I love to win. I love pushing myself to my physical limits. It's that feeling that first drove me to the computer. For every second that I am not playing cs, there is only an unquenchable thirst to play. A thirst that grows as every minute passes by when I am outside, sitting at the television, or playing sports. I had an extraordinary time playing this game, and I will return to look at the future students of this game to see that bright eager look on their faces to remind me of how I used to feel. This review may be over, this game may be dead, but I will never stop playing couner-strike (1.6). POG GAME.",Positive

10,"Siendo menor me hubiese gustado ir a un puticlub, pedir un baile doble con las t√≠as m√°s buenorras y no pagar nada. En el momento que me manden pagar, me arranco la barba postiza y digo: ""¬°Tengo catorce a√±os, lo mejor para t√≠ es que nadie sepa que estuve aqu√≠ JA, JA, JA!"".

Entonces, una de las strippers me mira horrorizada y le digo: ""Tranquila, esto no es algo que no haya hecho antes en el GTA, ir al club de striptease es el pan de cada d√≠a"". Ante esta situaci√≥n, el due√±o del local se pone a gritar y yo le digo: ""¬øMe vas a obligar a ponerme de puto a bailar para que os devuelva el dinero? Yo lo hago pero luego @Polic√≠a, ustedes saben lo que est√°n haciendo"".

Y luego le digo: ""Mira, quedamos en esto: Ni yo he estado aqu√≠, ni vosotros me hab√©is visto aqu√≠. Borrando tetas, borrando tetas, borrando tetas, borrando tetas"".",Positive

Let me say that that was one of the most fun things I've gotten to do when it comes to gaming. The maps were so old we didn't even remember most of the maps layouts (not including the more popular ones like inferno, dust, or even assault), but the maps were so goofy it actually became very fun.
