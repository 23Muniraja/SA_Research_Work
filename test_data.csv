counterstrike isnt just a game its a phenomenon released in as a mod for halflife it became a global sensation defining competitive fps gaming for a generation even today it retains a dedicated following a testament to its enduring appeal heres a deep dive into what makes cs so special gameplay that defined a genre pure tactical fps cs strips away complex mechanics and focuses on core gunplay and strategy every round is a tense chess match with players utilizing teamwork map knowledge and precise aiming to outmaneuver their opponents iconic weapons the ak the awp the desert eagle these weapons are not just tools theyre legendary each has its own distinct feel and mastery requires understanding its recoil accuracy and effective range roundbased economy the buy system adds a layer of strategic depth managing your money to purchase the right weapons and equipment each round is crucial for success diverse maps from the claustrophobic corridors of dedust to the open spaces of deinferno each map offers unique challenges and tactical possibilities learning the intricacies of each map is key to competitive play a legacy of competition esports pioneer cs laid the foundation for modern esports tournaments like cpl and wcg showcased incredible skill and fostered a thriving competitive scene community driven the games longevity is largely thanks to its passionate community countless mods maps and skins were created extending the games lifespan and providing endless variety skillbased progression cs rewards dedication and practice improving your aim movement and game sense provides a tangible sense of accomplishment why it still holds up nostalgia factor for many cs evokes powerful memories of lan parties internet cafes and early online gaming experiences accessibility the games low system requirements make it accessible to a wide range of players even on older hardware pure gameplay in an era of complex fps games with intricate mechanics cs s simplicity is refreshing its a game about skill not perks or unlocks however its not without its flaws dated graphics by todays standards the visuals are undeniably dated cheating unfortunately cheating can be a problem in online play limited content compared to modern fps games the number of maps and weapons is limited overall counterstrike is a timeless classic that continues to entertain and challenge players its impact on the fps genre and esports is undeniable if youre looking for a pure skillbased fps experience with a rich history and dedicated community cs is still worth playing today its a reminder that sometimes simplicity is key,1

lets put it this way this right here is my very first video game all the way from when this tiny little year old ferix discovered what a computer is and what games are my brother keeps a video of me playing the game while beating me with a pillow and laughing like a maniac in it honestly aged like a damn fine wine and still relevant to this day as cs is a complete mess servers aint really the same lots of vip bonuses for owning the game on steam lots of cheaters that own the sv or are friends with the owners but still the game is the same as i remember a damn classic and a damn good game uuh uuh something something fire in the hole,1

i am a year old biker and trucker father and probably one of the oldest people playing this game i am a single father to my son who is now my son got this game for from his uncle so we installed it on his computer and he started playing by the end of the week he had hours on this game this was horrible for me as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son as he is always out with his friends or just watching youtube so i decided to make a steam account and get this game to see if i could maybe play alongside him i loaded into the game and started playing but i was stuck on what you where supposed to do i asked my son for help and he let me borrow his controller me and my son then played in turns and i loved it as it was the best time i had spent with my son since my wife had died this game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well this game reminded me that theres fun to be had in everything and it has brought both me and my son many happy memories,1
best game ever,1
this game started my gaming addiction so this game never will be old for me and for others who also started the gaming addiction to them also i love this game no matter what,1

this game is good but not as good as my cinnamon bread what youll need a x pan preferably glass non stick spray tubes of biscuits pillsbury or otherwise and sticks of salted butter unsalted also works just be sure to add a teaspoon of salt in step teaspoons of brown sugar teaspoon of cinnamon tablespoon of honey tablespoons of milk heavy cream or buttermilk nondairy milks work as well see step for more info more as needed cups of powdered sugar more as needed step preheat your oven to and give your pan a light coat of nonstick spray step pop them biscuits open baby once you get the biscuits out grab a butterknife or use your hands you filthy animal and quarter them start laying em out in the pan spaces inbetween the biscuits is aokay cause we want that buttersugar to get down in there once we start pouring likely youll run into the issue of too many biscuit pieces not enough space so just kinda squish em down and try to fill in the edges and corners with an extra biscuit piece once youve got all the biscuits packed in there were on to step step buttersugar time grab your and sticks of butter and were gon melt that son of a gun personally i like to melt butter in the microwave but if you wan na get all fancy and pull out the saucepan then go for it aint nobody stopping you so for the rest of us common folk put your butter in a microwave safe bowl or pyrex measuring cup i throw it in there for like min and just check on it closer to the minute mark but we all got different microwaves basically you just want the butter to be melted with no chunks left in it so however long it takes to do that dont leave it in too long or itll burn and then you got ta go get more butter now youve got your melted butter add the cinnamon and the brown sugar to it and stir the everliving life outta that thing til its all nice and pretty once youve successfully crafted the buttersugar pour it over the biscuits in the pan my two main goals here are make sure every biscuit gets some love and fill in all the cracks so pour slow and steady step make it hot okay let me level with you here i am not a classically trained baking professional im just a regular schmegular person who likes the sweety sweets i have these up before and this is the step that made my spouse leave double check the oven is on put the little biscuits in the oven so that they can grow up to be big and strong leave them in there for about min be sure to check on your biscuits throughout the process what youre looking for is the tops to be golden brown like that real fresh baked brown that you see in the movies and tv and recipe sites once you see golden brown open the oven and dont be afraid to get a little greedy grab a biscuit off the top so you can see how the middle section and bottom of the pan look if it looks doughy turn the oven off and let the biscuits sit inside for maybe minutes again note the color of the tops and go back to your reference piece that you took out you want them to look like done biscuits i cant put pictures but ill make a guide if people are interested and go back through all the steps with pictures if it doesnt look doughy well then what the are you doing move on to the next step champ we got biscuits to eat step make the glaze in a good sized bowl whisk together your powdered sugar honey and milk if you dont have a whisk thats fine just go grab a utensil or something personal preference fork they look meaner than the other utensils nondairy milk users unite i really like an almond milk substitute here but whatever works works just know with the amount of ingredients were using here your glaze may come out thin and runny if it does dont panic and cry just add a little more powdered sugar in tablespoon increments add whisk and repeat if it still comes out runny once its thick enough go ahead on take your whisked mixture and and drizzle it over the finished biscuits and boom done you just baked something delicious if you read this far thank you if you liked the recipe thank you ill try to make a guide and go back through with pictures and gifs to make this a lot easier to follow if enough people want that call the ones you love tell em you love them let me know what recipe you want me to do next,1

its a really fun game if you can find a normal server with zero plugins try to find one i dare you all the servers are not even counter strike anymore with the amount of plugins they have and the most normal ones have loadout plugins that buys you the same gear every round or vip plugins with ranks and microtransactions for money bonuses or its just a different game mode all together like dm zombies or something completely unrelated to shooter games at all and the ones with the least plugins are completely dead so playing with bots is the only option which you can only do out of the box atleast with condition zero,0

h cs an elegy to timeless brilliance h in the realm of gaming where trends and innovations often shift like the sands of a digital hourglass counter strike stands as an enduring masterpiece its brilliance transcending the constraints of time itself this virtual symphony of strategy and camaraderie devoid of the visual grandeur that modern gaming flaunts is a resounding testament to the profound notion that true artistry lies not in the grandeur of graphics but in the depth of experience as i navigate the pixelated landscapes of counter strike an overwhelming tide of nostalgia washes over me carrying me back to days when pixels were both our limitations and our canvas every footstep every bullet fired carries with it the echoes of bygone moments reminding me that the passage of years can not erode the significance of the memories forged within this digital arena the game is more than a series of levels and objectives its a portal to our personal histories a lens through which we relive our youthful fervor and unbridled excitement for more than two decades counter strike has wielded its banner as the paragon of shooter games an archetype by which others are measured and a cornerstone of the gaming universe its gameplay mechanics while seemingly simplistic in comparison to todays sensory spectacles remain a testament to the axiom that complexity isnt the sole purveyor of greatness the mastery lies in how it distills the essence of competition skill and teamwork into a concoction thats as potent now as it was two decades ago in an era when a cavalcade of polygons and lifelike textures often takes center stage counter strike emerges as a powerful reminder that true artistry transcends pixels and polygons its austere aesthetics merely provide a backdrop for a symphony of strategy and camaraderie that resonates on a higher plane this game is a rebuke to the notion that visual splendor is a prerequisite for greatness a testament to the irrefutable truth that a games worth is measured in the heartbeats it quickens the friendships it forges and the memories it bequeaths counter strike doesnt just defy the ephemeral nature of gaming trends it shatters it as i stand on the virtual precipice gazing at the same pixelated landscapes that captivated me years ago i am struck by the realization that a masterpiece is not confined to an era its an entity that transcends its own creation an artwork that defies the eroding touch of time and a testament to the immutable bond between player and game so as i load up counter strike and embark on another virtual odyssey i do so with a heart full of nostalgia a mind attuned to the timeless mechanics and a soul humbled by the knowledge that true brilliance remains unswayed by the shifting tides of technological progress this is not just a game its an ethereal journey a celebration of enduring camaraderie and a reminder that pixels and polygons are mere vessels while the true legacy is etched in the indelible memories of those who dared to embrace its brilliance,1
great gaem love it very much especially when i can be racist to other players,1
i think this game was the beginning of so much great its a must have for every gamer classic thank you really thank you,1
old good game,1
in cs this also goes for valorant and lol you go in for fun and you come out neurotic but in this game i join a server and im really having fun but there needs to be a bot patch,1
yes,1
door stuck,1
it really sucks and i mean it just sucks why is this for a lot of servers are just trash to me that is rockets jetpacks its not fair zombies cant fly and with the admins abusing there powers for one i remember i took of a admins armor i infected him i left him and i realized he gon na use the antidot i come back around i smack him in the back of his head saying no bad admin dont do that he gets a rage boner and bans me right there because he sucked so hard on my inches of fat fairy cock but is there more yes for i had a admin block me with a remote car when i was the boss zombie and i could not do any thing but leave i did that i come back then get banned it was not fair and i was targeted i seen no one else get that lovely treatment but me and for rd this game is not how it used to be there some servers with two players being jerks and just team up on you as the zombie its not fun this game is pretty dead but still gets a good almost amount of players each day that i see to me i see it under players there was a server i really enjoyed when i was a little cub it was roz rise of zombies to me great admin not abusive with there powers great maps they had lots of secret rooms i could find lots of good times even the ze maps were fun but sadly its not steam you got to go on a unknown site and download it and connect to the server and thats a big shame one of the best servers i have ever played remember cs warzone that what i downloaded back then and well it got deleted it was a big shame i remember the first ever zm map i went on idk the name but it was a sewer with a out side and rooms out side leading into one room then a hallway leading into a sewer area and there was a place players can go up to on the sides of the wall and a secret in the water and there was another room near the room near the outside on the side small hallway leading to another room if you asked me dont buy this game its up to you but you might not get the same treatment i got who knows regardless some ze servers need a password idk why and lots are not in english it is sad that i cant play that server any more but from my times playing i still remember a lot of the hidden rooms and secrets in so many maps that i played on i was always the one hiding being the last one to survive till the clock hits its funny i remember some guy glitched me with sand bags i was like wtf dude then out of nowhere i glitched again behind the sand bags and behind the player xd then they broke threw killed him i was backing my fat ass up shooting and i was the last one to survive that is also why i love glitches it was so funny best karma that i have ever seen in my life,0

community servers are pretty much dead and drowned out in a sea of fake russian mirrors valve refuses to act because theyd rather we all just play csgo skinnerbox simulator instead which unexplainably suffers the same problem dont touch any cs game that is my sad take,0
reccomend this game zombie mod is great,1
cscz is better,1
this is one of my childhood games and it gives me back the nostalgia and its still worth to buy i have played alot of servers and its really giving me back nostalgia,1
i only have hours on steam in total i have over hours if you wonder how warzone,1
beautiful but filled with boomers who have played years and still are horrid so all the servers are tdm with rules a relic tarnished by time,1

to be honest this is great counterstrike much better then every other version i have hours on csgo and i still love this one more but i just cant recommend it because it is too hard to play on a server you need to find a local one they are mostly filled with people and autojoin works very badly so the best option that i had would be to buy a reserved slot from the server website and thats it too few playable servers and many that you can actually join and that have players lock your camera view on the spot,0

the legacy of counterstrike is practically unrivalled years ago the original counterstrike halflife umodu was ithei mostplayed online game in the world with a huge competitive following it was originally created by minh le and jess cliffe who saw popularity to the mod sharply rise with the release of beta in this also drew the attention from valve who offered to buy the intellectual property along with offering the pair jobs to continue its development on goldsrc valve acquired the games intellectual property in and soon after released the first instalment of counterstrike as a standalone game for microsoft windows in the final major version of counterstrike was released as version on september it is commonly and retroactively dubbed icounterstrike i in order to distinguish it from other counterstrike games the influence of the series in mainstream game development has been massive and easily noticeable in other franchises such as unreal tournament call of duty and battlefield for over two decades weve witnessed this franchise top the most played charts and it looks to continue with the most recent addition of counterstrike but for a time at least we were able to enjoy the peak of competitive shooting away from loot boxes microtransactions and ingame currency,1

this game saved my life i am my exwife and i have a daughter together and adopted our son together they are now both years old when we were going through our separation i found myself lost and miserable i was self destructive i got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that i punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion that caused me to break my th metacarpal in my right hand my working hand my games hand the hand that i held and carried my children to bed with the hand i desperately needed to make sure i could continue to provide after learning of the severity of my selfinflicted damage i was borderline suicidal keep in mind that just a few months before this i was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety i have never had fits of rage or been one to break down and cry but i was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side having nothing better to do i searched for a game i could play one handed while i recovered i somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews i decided that it had to be worth a shot i must admit i didnt beat the game or play nearly as long as some of you in fact i may have only played this game a day or two with that being said after doing so i had a new found joy and hope for life i was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me i was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness i was able to see the fruits of my labor i relaxed for minutes to this music long enough to realize that i was going to be okay after coming to that realization i turned the game off and i went back to work it hurt my hand like hell but i was motivated i stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself and i became the father i needed to be in that moment not the weak boy i was behaving as today i am close friend with my kids mother we dont fight or argue or say hurtful things to each other we are parents and friends i now have kids my third child is wait for it also years old the woman i am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly we have been in a relationship for a year now and are very happy together moral of the story you never know what life holds in store for you and if i would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me i wouldnt be where i am today this silly little game helped me realize that,1

my name is walter hartwell white i live at negra arroyo lane albuquerque new mexico this is my confession if youre watching this tape im probably dead murdered by my brotherinlaw hank schrader hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist shortly after my th birthday hank came to me with a rather shocking proposition he asked that i use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world connections that he made through his career with the dea i was astounded i i always thought that hank was a very moral man and i was thrown confused but i was also particularly vulnerable at the time something he knew and took advantage of i was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family hank took me on a ride along and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make and i was weak i didnt want my family to go into financial ruin so i agreed every day i think back at that moment with regret i quickly realized that i was in way over my head and hank had a partner a man named gustavo fring a businessman hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man and when i tried to quit fring threatened my family i didnt know where to turn eventually hank and fring had a falling out from what i can gather hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business to which fring flatly refused to give him and things escalated fring was able to arrange uh i guess i guess you call it a hit on my brotherinlaw and failed but hank was seriously injured and i wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over upon recovery hank was bent on revenge working with a man named hector salamanca he plotted to kill fring and did so in fact the bomb that he used was built by me and he gave me no option in it i have often contemplated suicide but im a coward i wanted to go to the police but i was frightened hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the albuquerque dea and about that time to keep me in line he took my children from me for months he kept them my wife who up until that point had no idea of my criminal activities was horrified to learn what i had done why hank had taken our children we were scared i was in hell i hated myself for what i had brought upon my family recently i tried once again to quit to end this nightmare and in response he gave me this i cant take this anymore i live in fear every day that hank will kill me or worse hurt my family i all i could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man for what he really is,1

ah counterstrike the game that put firstperson shooters on the map the grandfather of all competitive fps games and lets not forget about its younger brother csgo i mean sure its younger and more popular but can it really compare to the og i think not let me tell you counterstrike may be old but its like a fine wine it only gets better with age the graphics may be outdated but the gameplay is still topnotch the guns may not have fancy skins but they still pack a punch and dont even get me started on the maps dust more like dust too good but lets talk about csgo for a second sure its got better graphics and fancy skins but whats the deal with all these newfangled weapons whats next a grenade launcher come on now and dont even get me started on the microtransactions i dont want to have to take out a second mortgage on my house just to get a cool skin for my ak in conclusion counterstrike may be old but its still got it where it counts and csgo well lets just say its like that younger brother whos always trying too hard to be cool stick to what you know kid,1

timeless excellence in competitive fps review after spending hours diving into the heart of counterstrike its clear why this game has stood the test of time as a pinnacle of competitive firstperson shooters likes pure competitive thrill counterstrikes focus on raw competitive gameplay sets it apart every match feels like a highstakes tactical chess game requiring teamwork strategy and quick reflexes iconic maps the classic maps like dedust and csoffice remain not only nostalgic but also brilliantly designed the familiarity breeds intense engagements and strategic plays skillbased gunplay the skill ceiling for gunplay is high rewarding precision and mastery of weapon mechanics the satisfaction of landing a precise shot or executing a welltimed strategy is unparalleled dislikes graphical outdatedness as expected from a game with such a rich history the graphics are showing their age an update to the visual presentation could enhance the overall gaming experience learning curve for new players counterstrike can be intimidating due to its steep learning curve a more robust tutorial system could ease the entry for those new to the game recommendation counterstrike remains an absolute mustplay for anyone who appreciates the essence of competitive gaming the adrenaline the camaraderie and the satisfaction of a wellexecuted plan make it a timeless masterpiece while it may not cater to everyone due to its learning curve those who embrace the challenge will find an fps experience like no other rating,1

this game is probably the best game ive played in my lifetime so many hours put into the game the servers the mods the amazing community of players would never chose another first game in my lifetime,1
you dont miss the game you miss being happy,1
counterstrike a legendary classic released in its timeless appeal stems from its simplicity balance and addictive gameplay the games iconic maps and nostalgic visuals continue to charm players despite the emergence of more advanced games cs remains a testament to great game design and its engaging skillbased gameplay ensures its place as a true legend in gaming history,1

the og crazy to think a halflife mod developed by two people became the biggest game in esports history its still fun today even if you never played it back in the day its still cool to see where cs got its start i do highly recommend installing the mod to add bots so you can play offline i plan on using it to play this on my upcoming windows xp build if you are interested the mod and installation guide can be found here httpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid,1
better than csgo yes maybe the textures are bad and also the physcs but for its time it was the best game ever because people didnt had any fps multiplayer games to play at that time but cs brought a new era to the gaming world and it doesnt have cringe russian kids even if i connect to a russian server theres always laughing about how they died stupidly people who play this game couldve played csgo but they are just having fun and bringing back memories,1
gzel la good amk,1
great games maybe we need to make it popular again because this game is still good and playable i understand that people not playing this game anymore because this game is to old and there is so many competitors such as valorant csgo cod etc but this game is actually better then all the fps game for me ofc i dont know about the others its because you dont need high spec even in low spec this game still playable and i love how to server things go like we can choose any room i mean thats cool one last thing about the game is the game doesnt have matchmaking i mean such thing like queue match i hope valve give us some update but anyways thank you cs,1
valve is going full same as google,0
out of a simulator of people with a wooden brain that remained in generally ks no better than ccc and cs go i played everything the graphics are disgusting if you cant retrain how to shoot then this indicates your backwardness the woodenness of the brain and you are already years old at least lets create a petition about the need to close the game and it will not be possible to play it if you like the game then most likely you are retarded ill delete the review if they send me to a bank card,0

to this day the original counterstrike is still my favorite valve multiplayer game of all time counterstrike just feels at home using the goldsource engine planting the bomb defusing the bomb its such a fun game either way and it will always be one of my favorites of all time its easy to learn and its hard to master try out the original counterstrike if you havent already and youll get hooked almost immediately,1
i like this game it is cool,0
this game need fuckin fix every time i click on a key it sends me to other server or reopen the server,0
this game is much better than csgo aiming is way harder in this game which makes it a balanced game instead of just shooting once on the head of the enemy and winning,1
its one of the og fpss and it is very intensely fastpaced one of which does not demand an abundance of performance pointing towards system specs and it also is still being played currently todate,1

my name is walter hartwell white i live at negra arroyo lane albuquerque new mexico this is my confession if youre watching this tape im probably dead murdered by my brotherinlaw hank schrader hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist shortly after my th birthday hank came to me with a rather shocking proposition he asked that i use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world connections that he made through his career with the dea i was astounded i i always thought that hank was a very moral man and i was thrown confused but i was also particularly vulnerable at the time something he knew and took advantage of i was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family hank took me on a ride along and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make and i was weak i didnt want my family to go into financial ruin so i agreed every day i think back at that moment with regret i quickly realized that i was in way over my head and hank had a partner a man named gustavo fring a businessman hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man and when i tried to quit fring threatened my family i didnt know where to turn eventually hank and fring had a falling out from what i can gather hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business to which fring flatly refused to give him and things escalated fring was able to arrange uh i guess i guess you call it a hit on my brotherinlaw and failed but hank was seriously injured and i wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over upon recovery hank was bent on revenge working with a man named hector salamanca he plotted to kill fring and did so in fact the bomb that he used was built by me and he gave me no option in it i have often contemplated suicide but im a coward i wanted to go to the police but i was frightened hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the albuquerque dea and about that time to keep me in line he took my children from me for months he kept them my wife who up until that point had no idea of my criminal activities was horrified to learn what i had done why hank had taken our children we were scared i was in hell i hated myself for what i had brought upon my family recently i tried once again to quit to end this nightmare and in response he gave me this i cant take this anymore i live in fear every day that hank will kill me or worse hurt my family i all i could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man for what he really is,1

how i rate this game this game is pretty good but the steam version request bots because i like the classic games but why only mutliplayer i like playing hostage defuse the bomb base builder zombie mode and zombie escape modes and porting some maps for fun but i can only play alone updates this game is not dead allready because there are some players in the servers but the game needs some updates like bring back prison mode bots for steam version or add workshop to the game than looking at the sites with viruses in the maps what if there will be more weapons or there will be mods in the workshop or bot radio sounds for the players like i got blinded than cover me and some graphic changes glitches can valve fix the glitch with oilrig map because i played nonsteam version of the counterstrike to play with bots but when the bot was the vip the vip doesnt wanted go to the helicopter and glitched infront the stairs the end the reason why im making this because i want to make this game better than the old one and nonsteam version there are no more things that i want to say so bye,1
the point is its a joke first read my ccs reviev too understand its one shitty ass cs game of the franchise like that wasnt expected of valve evendough its fuckin old graphichs complete shit wtf was it made in ww because even than games had better graphichs like tetris its very diffrend than csgo even that game is better like ffs you can headshot someone trought the wall like butter goes in someones ass you can play on online servers witch garbage because the game is dead it doesnt have competitve mode or any other even if it had who would play it the game is dead im jack shajt at this game cant even shot toghtwards the enemy it has ahhhh let me see dedust and dedust and dedust frusteted repeats himselfdedustdedustdedustdedust and fucking dedust because noone playes anything punches desk else harder thanharder fuuking dedust breaks monitor watches pewdipie amnesia video goes to ikea to buy a desk remembers he neads a monitor not a desk like how tf you f that up gets monitor there are a some fucking retareded skins the defaunt and some bich anime big ass tities girls which you can play but if you go big ass anime bich assnigger tities ass its inposible to shot you because youll aim for the chest cuz obvious reasonds fucking bic has mental breakdown granades more like fucking barells you think it trows fast nope takes time as mucsh as trowing a fucking barell yoou trow it like fucking donkey kong like sound effect wooppp all look the fucking same how to play welp just fucking spray you wount miss the head because fuck hitboxes am i rightsits in turkish if you buy this game dont you worry youl get all the penissesses cuz by now all the guys saw cs in your libary and theyll see that you gay as fuck and they just wana fuck you in the ass untill your ass explodes of cum dont fucking buy this is complete garbage fucking nejirijan nejgger,0

counterstrike is one of the best firstperson shooter video games of all time the game has been around for nearly two decades and it has stood the test of time remaining an incredibly popular title in the gaming community counterstrike offers a unique online experience with intense fastpaced multiplayer gameplay the game puts two opposing teams against each other in an effort to eliminate one another players can choose from a variety of weapons and work together in order to complete objectives and outmaneuver the opposing force with its intense highly skilled play and thrilling moments of tension counterstrike is one of the greatest multiplayer experiences there is the visuals of counterstrike have been upgraded over the years but they still remain true to its roots the graphics are still far from being modern which gives the game a unique look and feel the sound design is also fantastic with intense sound effects and music that add to the intense atmosphere of each match despite its age counterstrike is still a great game to play while the graphics may not be up to modern standards the game is still incredibly fun and engaging for those looking for a classic intense multiplayer shooter counterstrike is an excellent choice,1

while not a bad game counterstrike certainly did not age nearly as well as source did the fov scaling that goldsrc uses makes this game very difficult to play on a modern display and from what i can tell there arent really a whole lot of pure vanilla cs servers unlike what global offensive has thanks to matchmaking cs is prettymuch only there for the mods at this point in a similar way to cs source but with the added disadvantage that the outdated engine is not only less compatible with modern systems but also is less capable over all for custom gamemodes source is a lot better for custom maps and modes as the engine limitations are far less strict and allow for much more creative tools source also has real physics instead of the fake ones that were carried over from halflife and technically quake as well since they were used for dead body physics before ragdolls were a thing this means better bhop and surf alongside other custom gamemodes that take advantage of the havok physics engine counter strike source also includes assets essential for certain garrys mod content to work properly which alone in itself makes it more important than in conclusion is rendered completely obsolete by both source and global offensive your only reason to purchase is if you have friends who you really want to play it with or if you are makingplaying custom maps or mods made exclusively for it that were never ported to source from what i understand did have some other differences in gameplay mechanics that many veterans prefer over global offensive but as a competitive shooter global offensive is more polished and more comfortable especially now with the crosshair customization if you want community mods get cs source or garrys mod a lot of source community gamemodes have even been ported to global offensive so if you dont have money you can play those for free,0
counterstrike is a classic game but it does not hold up to the great counter strike source or counter strike global offensive,0

counterstrike wasnt just a gameit was an era a phenomenon and for many of us the defining title of our childhood it consumed thousands of hours of my time and every single one of them was worth it this was the game that brought friends together kept us glued to our screens for hours and sparked endless laughter camaraderie and yes the occasional curse when a cheater ruined the perfect match having a steam account back then was a badge of honor a sign that you were serious about your gaming the competitive scene led by legends like smple was absolutely thrilling and pgl professional gaming league tournaments were the stuff of legend inspiring players around the world beyond the standard maps and game modes cs s vibrant modding community gave us an endless variety of experiences from bunny hopping bhop to zombie survival superhero mods and countless others there was always something new to explore and master each mod added its own twist making the game feel endlessly fresh and replayable counterstrike was more than just a gameit was a culture a community and a treasure trove of unforgettable memories thank you cs for the endless hours of joy frustration and nostalgia a timeless classic that defined a generation of gamers,1

the clunky movement and graphics that literally hurt to look at are not the only problems with this game not even close now we all know that if this wasnt made by your precious little valve studios you wouldnt even give this game the time of day but because its by the people that made half life that means it has to be good right cs go is only more dollars and for that you get much more content and you also can have gun skins deathmatch mode casual mode and competetive mode and it has about x the graphics first person shooters have come a long way since this games release,0
when i join a map it plays forlike seconds then kicks me out into my own lobby tried every server does not work,0

i dont even know where to begin with this review my steam account will be celebrating its th year this november and im feeling very nostalgic so i thought i would put a review that really showed how much i deeply care about this game and the impact it had on my life the year was i was a freshman in high school and met some new friends that turned me onto counterstrike right when source and hl were releasing i couldnt afford a computer that could run any of the hl games so i had to go with and boy was that one of the better decisions i made at that time for a physical combo of and condition zero at circuit city at first i was put off by how hard it was to control recoil but still enjoyed the challenge and was not interested in the competitive aspects yet until i discovered funmaps while stock maps such as dust inferno and train were all beautiful in their own way nothing could have prepared me for user generated funmaps servers loaded to capacity with endless custom made content that felt like you were playing an almost entirely different game the way some were created server sizes as large as players full with people all laughing and joking over voice chat enjoying the nonsensical yet so creative level design to me counterstrike was the pioneer for funmaps and user generated content no other game engine in my opinion aside from source could match the halflife goldsource aesthetic it was truly such a huge honor to be a part of witnessing map launches from the cherry clan and filming the iconic lue funmaps videos memories i will never forget including some of the friends i met and still talk with to this very day while it may never truly be the same as it was back then its surprising to see such healthy numbers still playing this today i often look back fondly at all the hours time tracking before steam was on xfire i put into this i owe this game for my curiosity in game development and modding given the accessibility was and always has been free to use cs is really cool and inspiring to see where the technology is going but i cant help but hope that one day more people will catch on to funmaps and look beyond the hyper competitive business model valve is pushing and try a funmap or two,1

fun game,1
never ending story about the keep it alive,1
this game is overrated,0
pretty good game,1
this game is where i got my namesake when i was younger i would constantly forget to buy ammo and resort to killing an enemy then ripping their weapon from their fingers still twitching i was never great but this game is present on several of my accounts if its fun enough for me to buy more than once then its fun enough for you to do the same,1
this game is such bad the grafix are terrible and theres no motion blur or lens flare or refraction saying that it is an old game is not an excuse the developers incompetence is inexcusable,0
nice game,1

making you forget your problems dont fix them senpai of the pool if all those hours would have been spend making art playing sports learning music or even reading books life would have been much improved after all those years become a sinkhole not even enjoying it at the start i was more into arena shooters but bad habits build in surely i got to know the flowstate learn taps handling stress in clutches edit cfgs learn game meta use strats and joke around with virtual teammates but none of this is useful irl specially nowadays where you can do soo much more with internet and the precious lifespan,0

horrible just horrible everyone gives this good reviews based on nostalgia i saw all the good reviews and thought i should try it out upon opening the game was a cringy menu i fiddle with the settings and theres no damn graphics options i put the crosshair on smalldefinitely not small so i go to servers and all the servers have horrible maps plus closest servers had players i click on a dust server with players when it loads up nobody speaks fucking english the buy menu controls were so fucked up i couldnt buy a gun so i stuck with the pistol i go through the middle and all the players look the same you cant even tell whos who literally the fucking same so i die instantly because i couldnt even tell it was an enemy bullshit i finally managed to buy a gun in the fucked up menu i find someone spray at em and surprisingly it was enemy my gun starts shooting in the fucking sky recoil over and i was burst firing absolute bullshit another horrible thing about this game its graphics and audio it just doesnt meet todays standards i think i might have to bleach my eyes after glancing at this game its horrible i only played the game for under minutes and i already want to kill my self trust me save your money if you loved this game as a kid i dont care get it but if youre looking for a good fps to todays standards dont get this garbarge save your ten dollars and use it to get your dick sucked by the girl down the street so simplest way possible graphics audio community experience controls gameplay overall game haha counterstrike,0

nothing beats vintage,1
earlier it was fun but now it simply sucks,0
addictive dull and repetitive counterstrike will eat up hours that youll want to have back there are two newer iterations of this game now both of which are similarly wasteful of time while one might argue that any game is not a productive use of ones days counterstrike ranks one step above almost anything out there unless youre freakishly good or an inveterate camper youll spend the lions share of your gameplay idly waiting to respawn more youll inevitably especially in run into players so good that youll be unsure whether theyre superlative gamers or superlative cheaters and in counterstrike theres really no way of telling prepare yourself for frustration either way avoid,0

i used to play counterstrike from the cd i bought at that time i havent discovered internet and no bots so i ended up playing alone doing literally nothing sometimes i explored the map a bit and wondered whats beyond the fences and locked gates designed to keep players in the map i also wondered how would people go in and out back then i havent discovered noclip but i discovered free look so i looked beyond them whats out there nothing yep nothing later i bought counterstrike condition zero that game goes to another review urlhttpssteamcommunitycomprofilesrecommendedhereurl years later i discovered the internet needless to say i didnt enjoy being killed by players thank you valve,0

i first played counterstrike back in when it was still just a mod i went to it on a daily basis for several hours as my main source of entertainment and gathering of friends until about when other activities came along i only went back to it now in this unveiled the greatest disappointment and proof of destruction of a game i have ever experienced as it is today this is not counterstrike it is a broken unrecognizable nearly useless form of the original game valve has let this game rot to death and still make an easy profit for nothing the server browser is a joke it is simply broken the results it returns are completely inaccurate and all servers you will find are run by nonsteam users with the game settings altered to who knows what and of them playing the dust map the other servers are running nonofficial maps and pointless game modes in addition you can not set your client to disallow the automatic download of custom server sounds or other trash that is forcefed through your connection to alter the game counterstrike has been so blatantly abandoned that it is shocking valve still charges something for it you will also see advertisements while you are connecting to the servers and while you wait for the next round once you have been killed counterstrike is the epitome of falling from grace and becoming an outright failure it has become an embarrassment and a gaming tragedy counterstrike is bad,0
great fun a game that actually functions,1
so juicy and sussy,0
really really really fun game also buy source too,1
best cs game ever existed,1
i cheated a student in a class in my high school out of ten bucks for a boxed copy that didnt register on steam he literally begged me for two days to buy it i finally relented and sold it to him he then spent the next day bugging me to give him a refund because he is an idiot also my true life story has single handedly brought down the community around this mod so you shouldnt buy it take that valve,0
i didnt get to play it during its peak but even after years it is a good game,1
almost all of the servers are in other languages and it is very hard to find a server where you can actually get in because most are locked this is the only game ive ever had that has bugged out when i tried to close it steam kept saying i was playing it when in fact i wasnt i closed it in task manager and even restarted steam but the issue persued i had to restart my computer for this game to stop adding time to my library,0
dust of dedust,1

looking back at this game it was pretty good but now it seems that it has the curse of most goldsrc games having mostly servers that are heavily modded or just dead but if you want a classic experience with this game try looking for non modded servers or create your own,1

counterstrike was a significant part of my childhood it was the first fps game i ever played and i first experienced it in on my oldest steam account which unfortunately i no longer use my memories from the days of playing counterstrike are filled with joy and excitement i recall the long nights spent gaming with friends where we fought together in the game and forged friendships that extended far beyond the computer screen we learned to cooperate communicate and trust each other to win matches these experiences shaped my social skills and taught me the importance of teamwork some of my closest friends today are the ones i met on various counterstrike servers we didnt just share virtual battles but also lifes joys and challenges these friendships are precious and im grateful for the memories weve created together even though time has passed and we may have lost touch the memories of those good old counterstrike days will always be a part of me its amazing how a game could connect us and create lasting friendships that will endure a lifetime,1
the best old game,1

broken physics engine very buggy fpsoverride fpsmax bhop easy tinyno slowdown on landing jumps fpsmax bhop normal normal slowdown on landing jumps fpsmax bhop impossible glued to the ground for second every time you jump cant walk while crouched cant crouch in vents thats just one example of how fucking broken this game is the timings are fps dependant what the fuck and its clientside not serverside so if you want to cheat you make a bind to set the max fps to and a bind to change it back to or which you use whenever you are not moving the lower fps you have the faster you move,0

no hakers almost many servers old memories,1
nice,1
what can i say about this game its special it its own way and i really like it for that fact this game also have some really cool and good maps that were either removed or remade in the later installments it has some cool game modes like zombie gungame climb fy and more this was a really good game but now it is completly broken you can join a game and sec later you get transfered to another server wich happeneds to be dust of the time,0
its cool because youu can play zombies and fight with funs so i recomned it and you can play it for hours a day,1

thought id find it underwhelming got it for due to the sale played it once then again and again this game is really fun not just because its an older game but its just very enjoyable the gunplay is really fun its similar to the gunplay in counter strike source seriously dont overlook this game because of its age its age is just part of the charm,1

ironic when you buy the original from the money you made selling cases in go also whats the point with oldsrc if its even more inconsistent to bhop than in the latest installment i had the impression this was made before competition and case unboxing stole the spotlight from fun and replayable gameplay oh well atleast the weapons sound better,1

if you have nostalgia for this game or would like to see how counterstrike started though this isnt quite the oldest version then get this game otherwise id say the gameplay is just an average unpolished s shooter css is a much better game oh also all of the servers are brazilian or something and will run scripts to make you join other servers and unbind all of your inputs,0

hpoints to consider before purchasing or installing this producth hthis is a review made after getting the of the progress h this is where it started despite years having passed the game is still active with its community servers it has excellent performance for lowend pcs so whether because you cant play its successors due to high graphics requirements or simply because of nostalgia counterstrike will offer you excellent hours of entertainment please dont cheat hpositive pointshlist valve break the gameplay cliche that many tactical fps games have excellent movement fun gunplay balanced economic system it has a large number of maps like no other counterstrike has semicasual and competitive community it doesnt have a workshop but it does have pages like gamebanana that have great content such as maps weapon skins player models etc excellent performance for gaming on lowend pcs it has the best input lag of the entire franchise list hnegative pointshlist the current anticheating system has a lot of vulnerabilities and is very frequent to find bad actors sometimes the community get very toxic for nothing and causes new players to end up having a bad experience there are usually war crimes racism sexism discrimination and bullying on the servers it doesnt have a campaign mode it doesnt have achievements it doesnt have a soundtrack it doesnt have bots its recoil is random so it is usually uncomfortable to follow the movement can be easily glitched to trigger exploits like bunny hopping side walking and ground strafing the map layout was left in the past making some maps unbalanced or frustrating compared to their updated versions in cs list code h table of irrelevant opinionh bpricequalityb bgameplayb price bugtroll or scam no not worth it simple recommended to wait for offer varied acceptable complex worth every cent complicated free to play competitive bdifficultyb bplaytimeb novice less than hours easy to hours normal to hours hard more than hours very hard from hours onwards unbeatable whatever you want to dedicate bhistory b bgraphicsb no storyirrelevant no graphics clichunattractive fuzzy acceptable retro very good cartoon fantastic detailed masterpieceinnovative realistic bsoundtrackb boptimisationb no soundtrack game is a bug annoying ruins gameplay irrelevant hinders the experience catchy few notable bugs inspiringimpressive very few irrelevant bugs masterpiece no glitches has been noticed code code bgameplayb bdifficultyb bduracinb bhistoryb h h bgraphicsb bsoundtrackb boptimizationb btotalb h h code code httpstoresteampoweredcomapp code,1

i am a yo father probably one of the oldest people playing this game i am a single father to my son who is now my son got this game for christmas in from his uncle so we installed it on his computer and he started playing by the end of the week he had hours on this game this was horrible for me as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son as he is always out with his friends or just watching youtube so i decided to make a steam account and get this game to see if i could maybe play alongside him i loaded into the game picked my character and world and started playing but i was stuck on what you where supposed to do i asked my son for help and he hosted a game for me to join i loved it as it was the best time i had spent with my son since my wife had died this game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well this game reminded me that theres fun to be had in everything and it has brought both me and my son many happy memories,1

starting as a mod for halflife cs had some key differences that made it stand out in competitive fps games at the time the modern settings when most fps games were science fantasy cs is strictly team based making communication and teamwork crucial no respawns during a round accentuated and intensified each encounter asymmetric objectives for the two teams prevented monotony purchasable equipment added a layer of strategy to the game beyond shooting players to score points,1

as someone who has played counterstrike i can say that it is an absolute classic in the world of firstperson shooters the game has stood the test of time and continues to be one of the most enjoyable and challenging multiplayer experiences available one of the things i appreciated most about the game was its simplicity unlike many modern shooters counterstrike keeps things straightforward and focused on the core gameplay elements that make the game so enjoyable the controls are intuitive and easy to master making it accessible to players of all skill levels the games community is also one of its greatest strengths players from around the world come together to compete and cooperate and the games simple but effective communication tools allow players to work together effectively this creates a sense of camaraderie and competition that is hard to find in other games the game also has a high level of replayability the various game modes and maps combined with the unpredictable nature of multiplayer gameplay mean that no two matches are ever exactly the same this keeps the game fresh and exciting even after many hours of play overall i can not recommend counterstrike highly enough whether youre a seasoned veteran of the franchise or a newcomer to firstperson shooters this game is sure to provide you with an enjoyable and challenging experience it truly is a classic that every gamer should experience,1
great not better than csgo but way better than cs i even made skins and its soo ez graphics meh gameplay beast bots dont have fun best,1

do you want to experience an old but classical game will this be the first time playing cs are you looking forward to not join a community of angry russian players if your answer is yes to all of these questions then nope go and buy another game any other game will do because you will grow to hate cs oh not because its a bad game per say but you will play against people with about years of experience meaning you will die die and of course die sure you can push on through for some months to get those skills as this game is very dexterity orientated but the question is will it be worth it well only you can decide if you are masochistic enough and no playing against badly programmed bots will only give you so much enjoyment before it gets dull furthermore it will not give you enough experience to stand your ground against real players once you have built up your confidence however if this isnt your first time playing cs then what are you waiting for buy it right now because it is just as fun as you remember it but i dont have to tell you this do i tldr an old school skill based shooter with an extrmely unfriendly learning curve inside a very cancerous community however if you find this review triggering then this is your kind of game and you should go and own some noobs because this game is gold,0
this cant be compared with warzone edition,0
lot of bugs if you play with steam play withouth steam,0
of the most epic and enjoyable game everthe main engine for the cs series recommend for people who feel nostalgic and new players as well worth the time,1
