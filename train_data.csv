steam says mins playing but i know the real number is higher i remember a time of days gone by i would pump in insane hours per day just to get rank of a server i played blueyonder server before it became virgin and closed but still steam says only mins a measly mins when valve upgraded to steam they closed the old hosting on won servers and my rank gone with it all those hours gone and this is from a time before before you kids all had global stats oldskool gamers didnt even have stats on one single server that was years and a few scripts away we were literally playing online for fun other humans were a gimmick at the time usee not even a medal pfft,1
og,1
good,1
op,1
no,0
there are still dedicated communities but the game can only see traces of its previous glory also there are multiple issues that havent been fixed for years it has weird bugs with player models making it really hard to hit people on purpose and not so hard to kill them randomly also has bugs with scroll ducking it makes sounds to be played at different location than you are which renders one of the core aspects of the game useless,0
best shooting gamebut the problem is that you dont have bots preinstalled so u have to download files from other sites,1
best game,1
best counter strike game ever made,1
sometimes less is more and this is less than cs,1
source,1
in my toddler times i spent a great deal of time playing this many sequels have come and gone but so far i still think of this as one if not the best version however it did not aged well most servers are filled with hackers or oblige you to install shady protection solutions on your computer so nowadays youre better of following one of the following options turn around and check tf turn around and check csgo,0
best game ever screw cs this is the best cs ever,1
my friend who i play cs with said if i post a review on this game and it gets likes and awards that he will buy me a rtx and kilos of canned ham so im just gon na leave this here shalom,1

wonderful steam classic but is insanely hard to get into as a new player in with how small and competitive the active playerbase is youre likely better off just playing modern cs though the charm of this game can not be understated and its a phenomenal fps game thats still very active,1
the servers are full of cheaters so shit steam never fixed this and my account was hacked that is why i moved to origin,0
how can you change graphics,1
year olds on crack banging their heads on keyboard would have made better game anti cheat especially lol,0

one of the best games ever made the only minus point i find is that it does not come with preconfigured hammer editor with it like the source games do regardless a timeless masterpiece worth playing,1
vanilla cs holds up okay but i only really play this game nowadays for deathmatch and especially zombie plague mods which are still incredibly fun as they were nearly years ago,1
god game,1
m bayonte,1
this is cs csgo and now cs are all good but they dont have anything against the original the number one thing i miss most about modern cs is that valve drastically reduced the number of objects that could be shot through pretty much every walldoorobject in cs could be shot through those were the days,1
game good but game dead is simple,1
i am a yo mother probably one of the oldest people playing this game i am a single mother to my son who is now my son got this game for christmas in from his uncle so we installed it on his computer and he started playing by the end of the week he had hours on this game this was horrible for me as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son as he is always out with his friends or just watching youtube so i decided to make a steam account and get this game to see if i could maybe play alongside him i loaded into the game picked my character and world and started playing but i was stuck on what you where supposed to do i asked my son for help and he hosted a game for me to join i loved it as it was the best time i had spent with my son since my husband had died this game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well this game reminded me that theres fun to be had in everything and it has brought both me and my son many happy memories,1

one of the most overrated game ever other mods died while cs didnt die when it should have the lack of changes and improvements to the base game trough years is utterly disgusting and not a proper excuse character slows down when its shot server side location tracking instead of client based for better accurate data years behind other mods that died,0
with the community servers that keep the game going its still a lot of fun to play i recommend it,1

i thought it was really complete but is it not i dont recommend this game and i think it is better the free version of the game better in different terms graphics are acceptable but there is no variety in itself the scenarios are excellent but you always lose very fast and most of the time you see only the cameras of those who killed you and only flashbacks,0

h i light my cigar h its a hot summer day in florida its always hot i hate dedust and heat of florida she walks into my office directly up to my counter and strikes up a conversation she looks tired shed been running around the community avoiding the mods i take a drag from the cigar it held in my hand by my lifted index finger my thumb leveraging the cigar and my clutched middle finger the mods a vicious group of talented hackers and moderators that have run the community some benefit others dont i exhale this community has been spiraling for a while we used to have a proud population of nearly thousand now a days we are lucky if we can get thousand people in the community most moved away from this cold place to a bright and warm global world i take a second drag what is it i ask she tells me she wants to leave this place she says that even though she loves this place the air flows out of me h theres nothing left here for me h i sigh i tell her i was late here i never saw what this community was like in its heyday i admit theres only two reasons most people stay here nothing but the bare bones of this community is original at this point i shift in my desk she begins to weep i take a drag of my cigar i admit to her the secret htheres only two reasons h i pause and exhale why anyone comes around these parts anymore her eyes light up she says she has to know the poor those who cant afford the global world riddled by capitalisms cruel nature and her breath taken aback with anticipation gary she gasps its always been gary gary is at the heart of this city and all who want to know gary must pass through here i take one last drag and toss the cigar into the ashtray hill save you the boring details h i say as i reveal my suitcase gary is enough for most people theyll stick through the crap in hopes of finding something in themselves with gary its enough for most people but its not enough for me i walk to the door im leaving this town i say and unless youre staying well theres nothing more for me to come back to she pauses then turns to me,0
old school the best,1
very good game one of the best if not the best of all the counter strike games,1
good game with alot of bugs,1
i can understand why this game was a smash hit but seriously doesnt hold up in todays time all the fanboys are the ones who grew up playing it and hence holding onto their sweet childhood memory nothing wrong with that i was introduced to the world of counter strike with csgo seriously doesnt hold up in front of csgo and i am not talking about graphics but multiplayer i am not the one who says a game is bad because of old graphics as i still love playing halflife and gta from time to time heck even original doom,0

i had put around hours into cs source because csgo is ass so i purchased this to see if it was just as good as source newsflash its not im not all that good at video games in general and im just no match for people who have been playing the game for years and no theres no bots i might change my mind later on but for now i dont recommend this game,0
an absolute masterpiece of its time i want those modders back who are responsible of its existence,1
worlds best game this game is actualy fun and can run on a potato though its sad theres no default bots support and no beta accesing with bots but the movement is amazing and dosent change your blue light filter,1

i had to come back to this game because csgo and cs were complete trash clunky inaccurate games that call it competitive play with handicapped players the physics of those two games are far worse that css the smoke clouds in cs take about an hour to dissipate giving terrorists an unfair advantage in the hostage maps how is cs any kind of sequel to cs cz and css it has far less of just about everything garbage wall physics for shooting through material i wouldve hoped they fixed the awp bug where you kill someone by shooting them in the foor or leg but nope they carried over the problems from the previous games and didnt elevate any part of the game play same game just less with crap graphics i dont see a big difference in graphics between csgo and cs i find the features and functions of cssource to be superior in every way from an interactive perspective calling that new game cs i find offensive to its previous versions,1
graphics you forget what reality is beautiful good decent bad dont look too long at it msdos gameplay very good good its just gameplay mehh watch paint dry instead just dont audio eargasm very good good not too bad bad im now deaf audience kids teens adults grandma pc requirements check if you can run paint potato decent fast rich boi ask nasa if they have a spare computer game size floppy disk old fashioned workable big will eat of your tb hard drive you will want an entire hard drive to hold it you will need to invest in a black hole to hold all the data difficulty just press w easy easy to learn hard to master significant brain usage difficult dark souls grind nothing to grind only if u care about leaderboardsranks isnt necessary to progress average grind level too much grind youll need a second life for grinding story no story some lore average good lovely itll replace your life game time long enough for a cup of coffee short average long to infinity and beyond price its free worth the price if its on sale if u have some spare money left not recommended you could also just burn your money bugs never heard of minor bugs can get annoying ark survival evolved the game itself is a big terrarium for bugs author httpsvojtastruhargithubiosteamreviewtemplate,1

some maps were quite nostalgic from when i was little and was cool how i still had a gut feeling for the set up of some of them even after a decade or more and not recalling any specific memories of them the maps themselves are cool the aztec one looks quite unique and while some are more iconic and are still alive in the modern game others seem to have been lost to time theres still some active servers though so game is still alive although larger ones seemed to be russian finding an englishspeaking one might be a bit harder but not impossible,1

counterstrike was a significant part of my childhood it was the first fps game i ever played and i first experienced it in on my oldest steam account which unfortunately i no longer use my memories from the days of playing counterstrike are filled with joy and excitement i recall the long nights spent gaming with friends where we fought together in the game and forged friendships that extended far beyond the computer screen we learned to cooperate communicate and trust each other to win matches these experiences shaped my social skills and taught me the importance of teamwork some of my closest friends today are the ones i met on various counterstrike servers we didnt just share virtual battles but also lifes joys and challenges these friendships are precious and im grateful for the memories weve created together even though time has passed and we may have lost touch the memories of those good old counterstrike days will always be a part of me its amazing how a game could connect us and create lasting friendships that will endure a lifetime,1

unless you have a nostalgia hardon this game hasnt aged well,0
one will find it is quite easy to encounter persons of highly polished skills in the original version of the counterstrike games this is evidenced by thousands of hours on many of the players records keep in mind that steam has not been tracking game hours for a good few years after it first came out with this mod i highly suggest one passes by this out of date game as classic as it may be i compare an exaggeration of the experience for a new player to that of being anally entered spontaneously by barbed nethers overwhelming painful and a strong sense of defenselessness one would do well to instead spend their time playing the latest sexiest version anyway after all the gameplay is an evolution on the one this game has to offer i also recommend passing over the current middlechild version source,0

this is a great game i played it for about years from the time of release until condition zero came out it was a groundbreaking in its time and its still great years later the only downside today is the the lack of players and legit servers,1
dont bother with this or condition zero as they are not supported and will not even open i bought this as part of counter strike complete as i wanted to play cs condition zero complete includes cs cs condition zero and cs source both cs and cs cz will not even open and run after lots of searching and trying to report a fault it became evident that steam do not support cs or cs cz i played cs source on the day of purchase for a several hours which seems to play without any problems for me on linux steam tried on the following day to get vanilla cs and cs cz running to no avail and unable to get support from steam after searching online it became evident that nobody is supporting vanilla cs or cs cz this begs the question why steam are selling a product which doesnt work and that they offer no support for and neither does anyone else to make matters worse when i requested a refund less than after purchasing the cs complete pack i received and email stating that as i played the purchase for more than hours that my request for a refund was refused well in fairness i had played a third of it for more than hours as two thirds of the pack does not work at all if cs and cs cz doesnt work then for pity sake steam stop selling it this makes you look questionable to say the least my advice is by all means buy cs source if that is your thing but to stay well away from any cs pack which contains non source elements,0
this is one of the best old games of all timebuy and play it,1
good game,1
its a game which can be played for a lifetime,1
its like cs but it doesnt lag,1

nostalgia so yes i do recommend it to whoever has played it back in the days,1
does have some multiplayer but all the modes are gimmicky and not fun not many english servers either,0
graphics counterstrike has graphics so ancient that its like playing with pixels from the stone age but hey at least you wont need a nasa computer to run it just a toaster will do nostalgia cs is like that old wornout pair of sneakers you just cant throw away you know theyre ugly and falling apart but theyve been with you through thick and thin cs more like a shiny new pair that gives you blisters every time you wear them community in cs youll find a community so tightknit theyre practically a family theyll welcome you with open arms or maybe just shoot you in the face but hey thats how they show love cs youll be lucky if anyone even notices youre there amidst all the flashy distractions skill ceiling cs separates the pros from the noobs like a sieve mastering bunny hopping and spraying feels like achieving enlightenment in cs you might as well just flip a coin to see who wins its all luck and no skill baby soundtrack who needs fancy edm tracks when you can listen to the sweet sweet melody of bullets ricocheting off walls cs s soundtrack is like beethovens symphony no compared to the dubstep mess in cs,1
the legendary shooter game this game starts the game era first esport founder with big cash prizes the father of csgo and grandpa of cs game which was a first game in gaming road the first unique shooter with v mechanics the game itself have really good online now k players not including nonsteam players in crazy stats for year game the problems with the game is cant mute person only disable voice chat by entering voiceenable and bulletproof any type of walls for example brick wall from denuke thats really annoying for cheaters thats heaven truly masterpiece from valve,1
cant believe i never wrote a review for this i spent a good portion of my childhood on aog servers gun game zombie escape you name it i was a regular every night from to pm eventually i learned about kz servers i sucked at them but i had fun just taking my time and climbing thousands of hours on community servers my aim was unmatched at one point eventually my computer broke and i had to work summers to get a new one after a while i bought onne and found out i could play tf on it so that was the end of my totally legit copy of counter strike a love letter to online gaming iconic thank you valve,1

classic counter strike and it is easy enough to add bots,1
counterstrike is the game thats been with me the longest in one form or another but for me it all started here many of the things i value most in games i value because of counterstrike good level design teambased dynamics the emphasis on skill the dedication required to master it a friendly sense of competition and a solid sense of community it taught me the joy of earning my victories in a game but also the importance of learning from my failures its the reason i love firstperson shooters and the reason i stuck by pc gaming at a young age and i owe it all to its earliest iterations ign,1

the original counterstrike a stonecold classic of preonline gaming era at least for me this title is assosiated with computer clubs which were the only place to play cs with friends that time and also with custom assets and new maps distributed on cds coming with gaming magazines this whole aesthetics has probably died because the internet became an ordinary thing in every house there are much more sophisticated multiplayer shooters with better balance physics or graphics so nostalgia is probably a key element to keep the community alive,1

counter strike is even fight between highly trained american antiterrorist team using latest in military technology to battle a group of really pissed madmen possessing crude bomb and surplus from ussr s army supplies despite all training and technology terrorists still have good chance of blowing up market therefore much like real life game is currently full of hackers who fly on top of map so unless you hack or like getting aerial teabag please play better counter strike sauce or counter strike go game this game has had its day and only exists for historical purposes i remember times when internet cafe and mosque full of this game no more,0

before buying this game you bmustb know if you play online and join online servers byou can get virusesb i was playing online and after a while i got alerts for trojans i cant believe i bought a game to get viruses bthe servers will install contents outside the cs game folderb so after uninstalling cs you will still have a lot of crap in the hard disk one example i had to manually delete cprogsteamappscommonhalf life because it was added by one of those servers to add custom mods still there after cs uninstall yes i am asking for a reimbursement right now you can see about the trojans in malwarebytes forums i am not the only one reporting this but i see that the post is half year old and the viruses are still there so no action from any of the companies cs or steam windows trojan keeps coming back by thumus april in resolved malware removal logs httpsforumsmalwarebytescomtopicwindowstrojankeepscomingback,0
counter strike is one of the best games that halflife created although its old and has few players compared to cs or csgo it still has the core mechanics that make the game really good the game does many things that are better than the current modern counter strike like the movement mechanics and shooting the community servers are still full with active people ready to play and have fun with you another really good feature that halflife and had done is modding no its not changing the game to have a significant advantage its more visual quality like importing csgo knifes to the game or having anime characters as your skin rather than the boring leet models all in all for a game that is technically in its extinction period people should still continue to play cs since the game never gets old and is better than cs or current cs full of cheaters and improper bugs,1

does the pope shit in his hat i dont know if he shits in his own hat but hes shit in mine quite a few times i dont know how or why he does it but at least a couple times a year ill be in my apartment by myself just living my life and all of a sudden ill hear this loud moan followed by giggling and an absolutely horrific smell at this point i know its him once i hear the moan so i get up to try to catch him but before i can hes already in the front doorway giving me this stupid smirk i always try to reach out and grab him but he just winks and runs off to the popemobile idling outside just to be clear i live in chicago not the vatican and as far as i can tell hes coming out here just to shit in my hat there are no big news stories about him visiting or anything like that but there is a page in an official vatican site that shows his travel schedule and it always says he had to make a brief visit for holy administrative purposes its also worth noting that hes in full the full pope outfit when he does this so its pretty impressive that he can move as fast as he does especially considering his age,1

i would not recomend this game i only own this game because it came in the valve bundle i do like the multiplayer because it is quite simple but i will not buy a agme just for the multiplayer even though i didnt really buy itso todsay i decided to play the campaign and there wasnt one i would only recomend for practise for counter strike source because they bassically look the same and i guess it could help boost your kdr but then again most people only play counter strike source to practice for counter strike global offensive anyway i would not recomend buying this unless you are buying the valve bundle witch is a must have for steam,0

counter strike i have very nostalgic memories of this game along with minecraft halflife and slender this is the most nostalgic game ever made i remember it like it was yesterdaythe day i bought the pirated dvd of cs which came with the bot mod because yes the game didnt have bots natively i didnt even have internet access and i played it on a tube monitor on my first computer a windows xp given to me by my moms boss i played this game so much id stay up all night and go to school exhausted i played each map thousands of times and when i got older i played against my friends in a lan house oh so many memories i feel so happy remembering those moments of people who are no longer here of simpler times in life this game is a milestone in my life and in the lives of millions of kids and adults to valve minh le and jess cliffe the creators of the original mod i extend my sincerest thanks thank you for this masterpiece and for the great moments it provided for an entire generation,1

counterstrike is the ultimate blend of strategy skill and fastpaced action with iconic maps like dedust a vast arsenal of weapons and an enduring community it remains a staple for competitive gamers while the graphics are dated the gameplay is unmatched offering endless thrills and nostalgia verdict a mustplay classic for fps fans,1
childhood,1
imagine playing csgo but with terrible graphics people killing you randomly through the walls no matchmaking system and malicious servers thatll rebind your keybinds to send you to their server without your consent thats cs this game is completely and totally deprecated in because of csgo csgo is better than this game in every way from gameplay easy of finding servers matchmaking and more secure servers basically this game sucks and its old play the new game instead,0
i dont even own this game,1
it does not work you have to fucking do a lot of things in order for it to work absolutely shit,0

best game,1
having experienced both csgo and counter strike i must say that aiming at opponents in counter strike can be quite a formidable task the mechanics and precision required to land those crucial shots take time to master however its worth noting that the game has garnered a reputation for its toxic fanbase its not uncommon to encounter players who are quick to kick you if they perceive your skills to be lacking for newcomers seeking a space to practice and improve their gameplay counter strike might not be the most welcoming environment the competitive nature of the game combined with the presence of experienced players can make it challenging for beginners to find their footing without facing criticism or even outright bullying despite these aspects counter strike still holds a certain charm its nostalgic graphics and gameplay continue to attract a dedicated community of players who appreciate its classic appeal if youre willing to brave the potential toxicity and put in the effort to hone your skills youll find a game that remains playable and offers its own unique experience even after all these years,0
i mean surprised the servers are still up tbh,1

this game was every competitive players dream back in high school days but caleague was so corrupted so many players were cheating then cal made their own anticheat then that anticheat turned out to be complete garbage admin giving crap judgement for example a player is cheating in a match instead of over turning the match he gives a warning of course valve had nothing to do with caleague and cevo caleague and cevo was there for players to enjoy the competitive side of the game but that didnt go the way it was intendedbasically all third parties who were providing competitive play some of the so called friends that were on my friendslist took my name and removed me from their friendslist and a few months later im getting asked hey werent you on suchand such team with some guys harassing females im like what the hell is this guy talking about weird stuff was going on cevo was also another corrupted league they banned alan in csgo when alan invited me to play with him in one season in csgo a player named maestro asked me to play with him in the main division so he tells me to pay for my spot which was ten dollars and be ready for the season the season comes and he literally removed me from the roster without letting me know there was no communication on what was going on but there was other players on the roster that i didnt know to much backstabbing in leagues esea at some point they changed every inactive member to have a at there name turns out someone was impersonating as me and they actually let it happen a few months later they changed everyones name back to normal except mine but the funny thing is a person named ryan thornstonnot sure how the last name was spelled but he and jacobson was on a team together for placement and then invite somewhere there something happened and the team broke up then we are hearing that ryan died in a car crash few years down the road then shroud on his twitch stream by the way twitch stopped content creators from keeping there videos for some odd reason so you wont find it saying that ryan is still around no not freakazoid so it had me thinking like wait a minute didnt they say he died in a car crash but i would like to talk to ryan and ask him what happened cause apparently i was being called a cheater from a few other players that knew a cali player and i know i havent cheated the calinvite team was confederacy and the tag was co,1

as much of a classic as this one is i have to say that it genuinely wasnt all that enjoyable just because a game is old and nostalgic doesnt outright prove the quality of it this is the case for counterstrike cs was first a modification for halflife and soon turned into a valve game soon it turned into one of the most popular shooters in history however during my walkthrough and gameplay of the game i noticed that the game didnt have a very active playerbase thats alright every once in a while you can find people playing still however the moment that i try to make a server for myself i realize that bots are nonexistant to add in your own private server there is definitely a way but i just didnt have time to get it to work counter strike source has this feature available at all times presented with the same boring menu that almost every single goldsrc game has halflife day of defeat any other cs game before css etc i couldnt customize the crosshair the way i wanted to i also want to mention how the ingame hud felt like garbage it was extremely barebones but overall its counterstrike its the first entry give it a break since then valve has been able to improve the franchise over time i personally wouldnt recommend it because of how barebones it is but if you like counterstrike try counterstrike source,0

edit and on top of that game is unsafe from exploits that will araara as much of your game files and maybe pc as possible admin being able to force certain commands on client too have fun counterstrike this one also known as counterstrike is a teambased multiplayer realisticalmilitary shooter and a very well known one at that it was first available as a free mod for halflife being patched regulary up to version until recently it got its way onto steam as a serapately sold title so how is the player base counterstrike being popular self has an active player base you will see many servers up to players at very least there are many russian servers as it had a cult following over there cant really see past them on bad side most seems to prefer terrorist plant c mode and then dedust is the most played map a lot of servers run small mods that may alter balance or other small things and most of it playerbase had a lot of time to play and master this game so new players will be more frustated than having fun learning counterstrike is a very well known realistical fps it gained its popularity while being free mod for popular halflife because it provided something else what wasnt overused yet realistical shootouts using models of real weapons you know in team multiplayer unforgiving and furious or unbalanced and twitchy oneshot kills with headshots whichever one you prefer counterstrike has two types of map first de is a mode where counterterrorists have do defends few market spots on map from terrorist one of the terrorists spawns with c in inventrory and has to bring it to one of the marked spots to plant it adn start to countdown of ts victory roles change as terrorists will have now to defend this place from cts whos aim now are to defuse the bomb in which case cts will win the round no matter how many more ts are left pretty interesting mode and most played otherwise this game would have been camping fest and if one site is too well defended ts can go to another one and then there is a second type cs in which cts have to to rescue hostages by bringing them back to base the problem there is that hostage npcs arent perfect though good enough and since cts have to rescue them all terrorist can camp in one of the spots around them since cts will have no choice but to come to win much less played and even if it does it goes like your everyday team deathmatch just killing all of opposite team much simpler anyway now the core gameplay there are few rounds each round starts with each team spawning on their side of map there is no respawning during round once person is dead he is out so you will have to worry much more about getting instakilled there are no items placed on map itself either on correct official maps no kind of medikits in spawn place you have seconds to press b button or whichever you set to bring up buy menu where you purchase weapons and equipment for the round witht he money that you earned so far yep when round ends everybody gets some sum of money to spend with winning team getting more an ingenius design decision that helps losing team to get steamrolled even harder what you can buy there is a pistol primary weapon and any of the equipment yep if it doesnt smell like prototype of modern military shooters once past purchase screen you are free to run and shoot and here comes the art of recoil and aiming for you see one of the more important thing that is used in this game is accuaricy of your weapon if you move it drops if you jump it drops it drops while you are shooting too thus it becomes more importanly to get good position making assaults more compilated and you often have to relearn to shoot making few clicks instead of just holding down mouse button you will have to be often walking instead of running to keep accuaricy while moving it also makes you silent so do it often or just stand and crouch sometimes burst shooting is better there and for long range targets you want to be just click few times another important thing is that you can shoot through some walls with more powerful primary weapons so dont be surprised for people shooting through door walls and even just over the corner it indeed does small damage to whoever is behind the game also emphasises aiming because it supports headshots and they do a massive damage and you also got three kinds of grenades explosive he which explodes good for throwing into chokepoints flashbang which blinds whoever looked at it when it blows for few seconds quite annoying but good for stroming into room and smoke grenade when you dont want enemies to see you coming and dont want to be under direct fire good for open spaces with snipers who instakill you when you peek around corner protip you run slightly faster with knife out and well while on theory it sounds interesting as well as empashises teamwork here comes the downfall of the game the weapons while make people with gun fetish happy are badly balanced around each other there are just best and bad weapons from pistols desert eagle is the best they behave as backup when you got no time to reload primary weapon shotguns are theorically good for close range but in this game they are useless and assault rifles can kill even better at close range submachine guns category had advantage of no accuaricy drops while moving but are still inferior to rifles rifles category has two best guns allrange assault rifle like ak and allrange sniper rifle like awp which doesnt even require headshot to onehit kill exactly what majority of people use the only machine gun is pew pew pew cant hit and allrange is allrange random is random you may run and shoot in general direction of enemy and pull off a headshot from your ak by luck or you may walk around corner thinking of your next grandious tactical plan just to get headshotted in instasecond by guy with sniper rifle from close range its just so full of cheap and frustating the rage is probably the main thing that keeps players coming back for more not honest fun as well as luck of possibly pulling few magical headshots slowdown when being hit doesnt seem to be good idea either making it harder to get away from the choke points and random spread is not actually random it just randomly follows one of the preset pattern and yes if you will learn them you will be able to control your shooting better and get on top exactly what puts apart newbiews and elites and exactly what elites seem to boast about when they want to say that counterstrike is the best because it takes more skills and time to learn with artifical challenges like this one that makes little sense and well once you spend your time to learn them you will still find out on top that it didnt make the game any more amazing but you know its not too bad it does teamwork well sometimes the game just works when you work along the team round the corners and storming the next room where you follow teammates supporting each other provide covering fire to the corner when upon entering next place each one covers his own direction as some of the rooms just have too many places from which enemies can shoot you smoke grenade and flashbangs help in these cases and its pretty damn nice at those moments until they get ruined by something stupid something you dont feel like could be prevented yea getting shot by sniper cant really recommend it because everybody who will like such games are already playing it and player base of this game had too much time by now that they will be just way too skilled for new players who will just get destroyed and it will take a long time to get onto same level its not like there arent enough militaryrealistical shooters anyway,0

this is one of the best most addicting games ever counterstrike is a multiplayeronly pc game played either over a network or the internet the game simulates terroristcounterterrorist action you can join either the terrorist or the counterterrorist ct team the two most common scenarios are bomb defusion and hostage rescue in bomb defusion one terrorist is given a bomb and must plant it at a specified location the cts must either kill all of the terrorists prior to the planting of the bomb or defuse the bomb once it has been planted in hostage rescue the terrorists must prevent the cts from rescuing the hostages a little background into the making of the game counterstrike is a modification of valve softwares game halflife counterstrike was not created by valve but by a group of people seeking to improve the multiplayer aspects of the game it is more popular than the original game played by millions of players all over the world note this game features graphic violence and should not be played by children,1

this game was much better before steam hosted on the won or world opponent network now there is too much lag the servers have poor hit reg many players use cheats the servers are too big in size anything over player for public is too many and defeats the strategy of each map all the steam interface adds too much latency and ruins the experience uk doesnt host any servers having to connect to far away servers adds latency which makes the game unplayable bots have also ruined the experience overall i would have to rate the experience but in the current year there isnt any multiplayer game i am able to rate higher than so it is par for the course,0

this game is so antiquated it shouldnt even be on the market anymore even if youre feeling nostalgic this should not be the game of choice in my opinion do yourself a favor and get on csgo and grab prime so you can enjoy a real game youre welcome,0
might be good for nostalgicveteran players but as a casual going through the valve complete pack there isnt really a way to get into it no official matchmaking or newbiebased servers almost no usbased servers high pings some servers apparently hosting malware a very difficult game to start by contrast all i had to do in tf classic was select the server with newb in the name and connect but eventually i managed to find a server and hear some beautiful mic spam eminem copyright infringement so my s sacrifice was not in vain,0

i really like counterstrike for several reasons firstly the classic gameplay is timeless and highly addictive as one of the pioneers of the tactical firstperson shooter genre counterstrike offers a perfect blend of strategy skill and fastpaced action the simple yet deep mechanics require precision teamwork and quick reflexes making every match thrilling and rewarding secondly the map design is exceptional iconic maps like dust inferno and nuke are expertly crafted offering balanced and engaging environments for both attackers and defenders the layout of these maps promotes strategic play and offers countless opportunities for memorable moments and tactical maneuvers the community and mod support are another highlight counterstrike has a dedicated and passionate player base that continues to create custom maps mods and game modes this communitydriven content keeps the game fresh and provides endless variety and replayability the competitive nature of the game is a significant draw whether playing casually with friends or participating in intense competitive matches counterstrike offers a highly competitive environment that can be both challenging and immensely satisfying the skillbased gameplay ensures that victories feel earned and rewarding performance and accessibility are also strengths of counterstrike the game runs smoothly on almost any modern hardware making it accessible to a wide range of players its straightforward mechanics and minimal system requirements mean that anyone can jump in and start playing however there are a few drawbacks the graphics and visuals are dated compared to modern titles while the gameplay remains solid the games visual fidelity may not appeal to players used to more contemporary graphics learning curve can be steep for new players mastering the mechanics maps and strategies takes time and practice which can be daunting for newcomers the game can also suffer from occasional cheaters and hackers which can disrupt the fairness and enjoyment of matches while community servers and anticheat measures help mitigate this issue it can still be a problem lastly the lack of builtin matchmaking and modern features can be a downside unlike newer titles counterstrike does not have advanced matchmaking systems leading to potential imbalance in player skill levels during casual matches overall counterstrike is a classic and highly influential game that continues to offer a compelling and rewarding experience its timeless gameplay exceptional map design and strong community support make it a standout title in the tactical shooter genre despite some dated visuals a steep learning curve occasional cheaters and lack of modern features the games strengths make it well worth playing verdict if you appreciate tactical shooters and want to experience a piece of gaming history with deep skillbased gameplay counterstrike is a mustplay its enduring appeal and competitive nature make it a timeless classic,1

many firstperson shooter games over the decades have tried to ride the wave of this banger not one can compare the feeling of community with all the custom maps and servers is topnotch even in there still exist a large swath of nostalgic people enjoying the game in custom map servers during the weekends i was a mere child playing this game in dark netcafes and even as an adult today shaping the choice of my professional career i hope cs or the next few iterations can take hints from this gameplay because it was fun for all of us,1
i love hackers they make it interesting,1

phew men thats my childhood right here dont believe the hours there is on my account i most likely have over hours on this game alone where do i start this is one of the first games i played the mods are amazing i used to be a big fan of hns and zombie mode is crazy gungame is fun and jailbreak as well this game is worth every penny too bad as a kid i didnt have a credit card now this days its hard to recommend its old dated i can not recommend it for my nostalgia status css or csgo however are what i would recommend i actually like css more then csgo in can not recommend it but boy do i love this game,0

counterstrike a timeless classic has kept me hooked for years its tactical gameplay enduring popularity and nostalgic charm make every match epic while the graphics may show its age the intensity of each round cements its place as an fps legend,1
dont just dont every server screws with your cfg and makes you connect repeatedly to another server upon button presses absolutely unplayable and extremely over rated in the first place,0
amazing game basically ruined by the players you cant find any normal servers nowadays the best games i have is by inviting friends and creating our own servers ive been playing this game since i was a kid and after buying the steam version i can agree that its much better than the cracked one but your pc still can explode while joining some servers toxic players toxic admins cheaters buy at your own risk,1
the best game ever,1
very good game even these days it is better than cs and the movement way crisp than the new cs movement,1
yes,1
d,1
what to say about this game an absolute classic legendary it may feel a bit strange after playing more modern fpss but after a couple of hours you get used to it and can enjoy in all its splendour,1
hiii,1
en pure nostalgia i remember playing pirated cs on my dads pc with strangers gold times bg cs,1
my friend i play with said that if i post a review about the game and it gets likes and rewards hell buy me a bag of chips and a rtx so ill leave this here,1
peak counterstrike,1
counterstrike is a legend that never loses its brilliance even after years intense gameplay a simple concept and memories of long hours spent on servers keep this game emotionally charged for fans of shooters its a mustplay title that reminds us where our love for esports originated,1
good game you should get the new one aswell,1

this game did a lot of neat things for its time but dont get it now theres no reason to buy something that isnt an m or an ak and if you are a ct that just got a kill you drop your m and take his ak unless you memorize the recoil pattern on the gun youre firing you will lose every time not that it helps because anyone still playing this game has been playing for years and will know where you are at all times and be able to awp you a new ventilation shaft in your forehead from yards the same second your arm moves into visibility from behind a door just hold your horses and lets hope they save counterstrikes from itself with csgo,0
nostalgia,1
the best game,1
cs is one of the greatest and undermined games in history it is in my opinion the best game to ever have a crosshair it is not a contact sport so for the girly girls it is an activity to indulge in it starts off with a team trying to kill another team cs is unique among the games because it teaches all of us that no matter where we are in life there is a role for us to play and we can help our fellow man by fulfilling that role and thereby our destiny what destiny might you ask i spoke before of unity and it is that unity that brings us all together like one big loving family that is the nature of counterstrike the many working as one one machine made of well oiled cogs and wheels moving in unison happy to play their part in the production of something greater than themselves not that these small metal objects are actually animate im of course speaking only metaphorically ver the course of the years i have increased in skill but i have learned a greater lesson than how to be a better cs player i have learned how to cooperate with a team to accomplish a goal that we all share even if that team is less than ideal i have realized that cs is about more than just ones athletic ability instead there is a deeper meaning behind the colt the ak the awp the deagle the sands under my feet in d or inferno and more importantly the teammates at my side i love them it is the human element of cs that gives cs its greatness in conclusion i love cs i love to win i love pushing myself to my physical limits its that feeling that first drove me to the computer for every second that i am not playing cs there is only an unquenchable thirst to play a thirst that grows as every minute passes by when i am outside sitting at the television or playing sports i had an extraordinary time playing this game and i will return to look at the future students of this game to see that bright eager look on their faces to remind me of how i used to feel this review may be over this game may be dead but i will never stop playing counerstrike pog game,1
reviews with thousands of hours well never get back says it all its a great addition to have in your steam library most especially if you grew up playing counterstrike,1
i am riding a high from the pure unadulterated nostalgia injected directly into my veins its like black tar and uncut coke with a quarter bar of xan to take the edge off i am seamlessly transported back to in my first year of college up late playing on a cozy server with some very nice but slightly odd people some things never change sometimes thats bad but this time its so very good,1

simple game as simple were the times when i used to sink days into it sure nonsteam but hey at least can do this to pay little tribute i thought i cant get into csgo because i already burnt myself out on the game in my youth but while it still holds true ive noticed that this old game is much more satisfying to just pop in and play a little not sure is it the nostalgia or perhaps simple fact that you only open up the game pick a server and just playthats it no strings attached no crazy menus attacking you skins sales offersits just pure in a sense although it may be funny to speak of purity while community servers live out of being at the very least midmodded with custom music prompts gameplay tweak etc but hey it only makes it more enjoyable in my opinion its very much like different game modes as whatever mod is being run on a server it will get downloaded while joining no external input required in the end its an old and simple fun no tryhard ranked queues skins no fomolike damn as if i just played a gamebut if thats so then what are we typically playing these days,1
i love counter strike i have made a lot of long term friendships from this game with people all over the world i met one of my best friends in this game he is from canada i have been friends with him for over years we still talk about this game this game brings people together and i am very thankful for it,1

counterstrike is a timeless classic that revolutionized the world of firstperson shooters its balanced gameplay combined with simple yet effective graphics creates an experience that is as engaging today as it was when first released the strategic depth requiring players to master teamwork communication and tactics makes every match thrilling and rewarding the community support and the endless stream of usergenerated content keep the game fresh and exciting whether youre a veteran or a newcomer counterstrike offers a pure and exhilarating competitive experience that stands the test of time,1
good game might get big some day,1
really good game dd,1
been playing this game for years my reliable go to game enjoy the v maps,1
this game is bad like really bad the game is dead with maybe like players in total and chances are youll join a russian server just to get banned for speaking english or having an english name if you do manage to find a game where you wont be banned or kicked you wont have much fun since the game is so buggy that everyone that dies looks like their standing up and gets you killed because you shot them instead of the one alive guy i legit loaded into a game where everyone was tposing while im sure counter strike has given people some fond memories this game has headed to the game graveyard for sure and should probably be made free because anyone who wastes on this game might likely regret it,0

i recently had the opportunity to dive into the gaming history by playing counterstrike and let me tell you its an absolute classic that still holds up incredibly well today gameplay counterstrike is renowned for its addictive gameplay and its easy to see why the blend of teamwork strategy and skill required to succeed is truly unparalleled the moment you join a match the adrenaline starts pumping and every round feels like a new challenge the simple yet effective mechanics make it accessible for both new players and veterans the thrill of defusing a bomb or clutching a round is unlike anything else in the gaming world graphics and sound given that this game was released in its no surprise that the graphics are a bit dated however theres a certain charm to the pixelated character models and lowres textures its like stepping into a time machine and experiencing the roots of modern fps gaming the sound design on the other hand is timeless the gun sounds and footsteps are still some of the most iconic in gaming history adding to the overall immersion community the counterstrike community is something truly special despite its age there are still dedicated servers and players worldwide i was pleasantly surprised to find a welcoming and helpful community of gamers willing to teach newcomers the ropes its a testament to the enduring appeal of this game that people are still so passionate about it nostalgia factor for someone like me who didnt grow up playing counterstrike theres a certain nostalgia factor thats hard to ignore its a trip back in time to the golden era of pc gaming even though i didnt experience it when it first released i can appreciate its historical significance and how it laid the groundwork for the modern esports scene conclusion counterstrike might not have the flashy graphics or features of todays shooters but it doesnt need them its gameplay and sense of camaraderie within the community are timeless its a reminder of what made competitive gaming so compelling in the first place if you havent played it yet i highly recommend giving counterstrike a shot its a classic gem that has rightfully earned its place in the gaming hall of fame,1
counterstrike global offensive is the current iteration of valves topinclass competitive shooter and the first to be maintained in the very modern way it has been learning from its experience with team fortress valve has a miniature economy in cs go that revolves entirely around gun decals players get a few drops a week after matches which can be a gun decal or a weapon crate the latter of which cost to unlock with a oneuse key from the store obviously this economy is tailormade and so there are extraordinarily rare and mysteriously fantasticlooking gun and knife skins with prices in the hundreds of pounds then a large range of other skins tapering down to the commonasmuck variety that trades for pennies i dont pay much attention to the cs go economy as a whole though its interesting enough but its important for a nonplayer to understand that a big chunk of the games audience takes it very seriously indeed in the days after a new operation launches countless forum threads are launched about the value of the new goods whether someone should sell this new rare drop they got or hold it for a while twitch streams with giveaways and crates being unlocked and so on you get the picture i give such context on cs gos economy because even though it is a subsidiary part of the game to many including myself it is the molten core of operation vanguard cs go is a regularlypatched game but the major updates come in the form of operations that introduce new maps and new skins at the price of around for an access pass with the nice touch that maps are available to all players regardless or made so shortly afterwards to give an exhaustive history of operations would be no more useful than a general overview if you play counterstrike then the chances are you play a lot of counterstrike what the operations do is freshen things up a bit naturally they dont disrupt the regular dustmirageinferno cycle of competitive play but you get some unfamiliar environments to tool about in the chance to score some fancy new weapons and in the context of a game you play almost daily a few times a year is chicken feed operation vanguard is different and the changes are not for the better the first problem i have with it is major the way its sold seems to skirt the borderline of deception to participate in operation breakout you bought an allaccess pass for to participate in operation vanguard i bought an access pass for the difference is obvious sidebyside but of course when ov popped up in counterstrikes home menu i bought it more or less instantly thinking this was the same thing ovs selling point is two campaigns a series of missions with three branching paths the missions are things like win rounds on map x and kill chickens in deathmatch mode and completing one bags a predetermined award either a weapon crate or a random weapon from a specified collection so far so ok but in fact ov has two more campaigns both of which cost to access which follow more or less the same pattern to be crystalclear about this the money is not the problem im happy to pay for operations and ovs combined total of around in the context of the time i put into counterstrike is really not an issue but that switch from allaccess pass to access pass with the right to buy more access just pissed me right off first of all i felt conned i bought the ov pass in the same way id bought all the previous operation passes expected it to be the same deal and realised id been fooled by the removal of all secondly what the two extra purchases offer is basically a reskinned version of ovs mission book but thirdly and this is the real killer youre encouraged to buy them to selfmedicate the most egregious enormous climactically wrong and frankly offensive design decision in vanguard there are multiday cooldowns on missions thats right rambo you may have thought you were buying another set of missions and drops to liven up daytoday business in cs go but in fact vanguard is a campaign designed to play out over a set period of time with the only limiting factor a bald external one cooldown timers let me set the scene for you i love counterstrike i saw vanguard was out on a thursday and cleared friday night got in a few beers booted it up and bought the pass i played the first mission cleared it in about minutes chose a second the killing chickens one and that was another mins so around half an hour into my evening of joy i was given a fourday cooldown for the next mission you can slice this any way you want but its bullshit the sad thing is i get the thought process behind it consider youre valve in charge of a game where players a want new content but b put in so many hours that theyll rush through anything almost instantly for example mission chains operation breakout introduced missions in the form of random drops which parcelled them out over time but had no larger arc it was fine but the missions never felt important so operation vanguards missions are in structured patterns with defined rewards and are given the desired longevity through simple brute force of timing you will not complete this content before we say so because you cant oh except that if you buy the extra mission packs your cooldowns decrease across the board because now youre allowed to do more missions in a set period thats right youre basically paying to reduce cooldowns in a valve game the thing is that operation vanguard is only a campaign in the same way that a pile of biscuits is lunch the missions are basic objectives like win competitive rounds on season or get famas kills in deathmatch mode and what do you get for completing them either a drop from an existing collection of guns with a minor chance of a rare gun or a weapon crate the first is fair enough but the second i mean at this point i already felt pretty rinsed by operation vanguard and now its rewarding me with crates that i need to pay more money to open there is a school of thought that says valve has done this in order that a flood of new crates and mission rewards doesnt flood the ingame economy instead trickling them in over the coming months to that argument the only appropriate response is who cares i play counterstrike go because its a great game i dont play it because of the economy and while i accept the latter is how valve makes money the moment it starts intruding into the game if indeed this explanation holds water then the economy is not acting in the way that it should that is it should be improving the experience rather than throttling it the sad thing is that operation vanguard comes with my favourite selection of community maps yet including two in season and back alley that feel like potential classics yeah theyre all over the place in terms of favouring one side or the other but this is par for the course with cs go and will be tweaked over the coming months every cs go operation freshens the game up with some new environments if nothing else and the point of operation vanguards structure is to elongate this beyond a few days to really showcase these excellent maps by forcing people to play on them semiregularly for missions it at least manages this i want to emphasise that im an enormous fan and c,0

here you will see why i love counterstrike but in my review you will read about why i gave it a negative review due to some problems i love counterstrike i love the feel of counterstrikes guns more than counterstrike global offensive now i remember back in when i first played counterstrike it had directx support and now with valve pushing linux support and removing directx from the gold source engine video games adding opengl support to the gold source engine video games i keep getting opengl errors every now and then and some freezing issues which i do not remember ever happening with directx here is a screenshot of one of the few opengl errors i experience here and there followed by freezing of the video games that use opengl before crashing httpscdndiscordappcomattachmentsopenglerrorsonvideogamesthatuseopenglonwindowspng valve please add directx support or at least a more up to date version of directx support which supports bit which is directx c i believe otherwise i can not give counterstrike a positive review due to these technical issues which i can not seem to fix even if i reinstall windows or counterstrike also valve please release counterstrike with counterstrike condition zero counterstrike source included for sale on gogcom you have said with the source engine that video game developers developing video games on the source engine can release the video games that they develop for sale on gogcom please,0

i want to bring to your attention that there are people attempting to scam you out of your steam points the following comment is a copyandpaste from multiple reviews on steam these individuals use this tactic to manipulate you into giving them steam points using appeals to your compassion but in reality it is all lies and deceit i am a year old father probably one of the oldest people playing this game i am a single father to my son who is now my son recently started dinkum and in less than a week he had already played for over hours this was terrible for me as it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son as he is always out with his friends or just watching videos on tiktok so i decided to make a steam account and get this game to see if i could maybe play alongside him i loaded into the game did the tutorial but i was stuck on what you where supposed to do i asked my son for help and he hosted a game for me to join i loved it as it was the best time i had spent with my son since my wife had died this game has ever since brought my son and i closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well this game reminded me that theres fun to be had in everything and it has brought both me and my son many happy memories please help spread the word by liking this review so that more people can become aware of this issue thank you,1
still the same tight and rewarding gameplay now all it remains is a chill and mature community big plus that theres no fomo microtransactions or battle passes,1

due to counterstrike and condition zero being bundled together in the steam store the review has been divided into two parts covering both games part counterstrike counterstrike is one of the most wellknown and beloved multiplayer games in history players take on the roles of terrorists or counterterrorists and battle for control of specific objectives the game is renowned for its incredibly intense and thrilling gameplay that can captivate players for hours on end pros simple and intuitive controls easy to learn hard to master personally a plus for me large variety of maps and weapons dynamic and exciting esports gameplay cons lack of a singleplayer campaign outdated graphics some maps are unbalanced in summary counterstrike is an excellent multiplayer game that provides many hours of intense and thrilling gameplay while the graphics may be outdated the simple and intuitive controls high level of difficulty and dynamic gameplay compensate for this inconvenience if youre looking for a multiplayer game with a large number of maps and weapons counterstrike is the perfect choice part counterstrike condition zero counterstrike condition zero is an expansion of the iconic multiplayer game counterstrike the game offers new maps weapons and game modes as well as a singleplayer campaign which was lacking in the previous installment pros large number of new maps and weapons introduction of a singleplayer campaign game modes available in both singleplayer and multiplayer graphics and sound have been slightly improved cons some elements of the singleplayer campaign are tedious numerous bugs and instability lack of significant changes in multiplayer gameplay compared to the previous installment in summary counterstrike condition zero is a successful expansion of the iconic multiplayer game the introduction of a singleplayer campaign and new maps and weapons are certainly a plus but numerous bugs and instability as well as the lack of significant changes in multiplayer gameplay are serious drawbacks if youre a fan of counterstrike youll surely find something for yourself in this game but if youre a cautious player its worth considering other options,1

this game is magnificent so magnificent and flows with the feeling of pure nostalgic this game is over years old yet were still here and keeping it alive how wonderful old textures old voice lines menu weapons grenades this game has been a huge part of my childhood that i will keep for a very long time in my memories tired of cs yall missing out the old fashion then lets hop on back to cs and cs source old but gold,1
this was probably the best version of the counterstrike ever made,1
hmm,1
best game ever,1

best fps game ever,1
old but gold,1
going back to after playing cs was such a breath of fresh air because of the classic shooting and movement i mean it was nice but the main thing this game has going for is that you can actually get into a game and play without crashes or freezes,1
this game is good and fun but the problem is you die way too quicklythe game is fun when you start getting good and into the action but i wouldnt reccomend because at sometimes it gets you really madthe casual servers are down so you have to be playing community serversoverall not to fun to playto difficult,0
i started playing cs in with version and have since accumulated so many great memories over the years of playing the goat fps,1
theres a school based on this game,1
this legend will always be in our hearts,1
njeh,1
a masterpiece not only amazing for its time but im having a blast still playing it today the strongest point of this game is the engine essentially the half life engine even to this day no other engine that ive seen has managed to capture the intricate movement mechanics that cs provides the strafejumping longjumping endless bunnyhopping and the thousands of custommade maps and addons there are give the player the utmost freedom to explore the cs world and exploit the engine to its fullest potential the move to the source was a downgrade it comes nowhere close to feeling as smooth and responsive as the half life engine even though most of the servers are empty now i still have a few that i frequent with a healthy amount of players and with the help of a few mods lan can provide just as much content maybe its not for everyone especially for those that have become accustomed to the newest flashy fortnite clone but for me the game deserves nothing less than a thumbs up edited the review to negative because fuck steam and fuck valve go to gog for a much better platform where you actually own the games you pay for and you dont have to deal with the brain damaged monkeys on steams customer support,0
spent more than years playing this game never regret,1

where from still sik the game,1
cool,1
i never liked this game nor i do now i remember someone showing me cs back in its golden days when it was the only counter strike available at the time and i told him that i would never play such bs well i kinda kept my promise at least until css came out anyway only a veteran can play this garbage or a person that likes selftorture hreasons why you shouldnt buy or play this gameh list percent of community servers arent english thats self explanatory of community servers are actually cracked by using dproto which lets nonlegit users to connect to find a steam only server is the same as finding a rare gem i am not kidding of nonsteam players cant get vac banned you know what it means oh yeah cheaters of nonsteam players can also ditch serverbased bans too all they have to do is use a steam id changer and bang they are back with their hacks of nonsteam players can and will steal your bought privileges or admin rights by changing their steamid to the one that matches yours which is an identity theft if they end up getting banned while using your id well you will be banned as well percent of the player base of cracked servers is nonsteamers once again good luck with playing against their hacks hit boxes in this game turn out to be quite buggy especially while planting crouching or using ladders have you ever shot an afk terrorist right in their forehead but didnt do any damage well welcome to cstrash of community servers will alter your config or hud files in one way or another and obviously without your permission why because they simply can which should not be a case dont be surprised that after visiting some fishy server you would end up with a bunch of key binds that redirects you to various servers or spams advertisement messages in the game chat of servers use redirect loops in order to get all players on a different server ever had a case when you tried to join the na server but ended up in some brazilian one this is how redirect loop works they host some fake server with fake online in the different region of their original server and once a player joins the fake server he gets instantly transferred anywhere they programmed thats just pathetic to boost your online that way its just like ordering pizza but getting a hamburger in the return would you be happy no of eastern servers offers a free vip for girl gamers that use a microphone the owners of these servers must be horny af sexism at its finest list,0

best thing about this game is the mods and the server browser there are no competitive ranks so you just most of the times play for fun there are custom game modes which counter strike global offensive doesnt have,1
i liked the part where i used to own this game on my steam account i dislike the part where i logged in one day for the game to be gone from my list and steam refusing to give it back to me even tho i have almost k hours played on this account how can i play thze game if i didnt own it fuck u steam,0
such a timeless classic,1
good old days when i was a kid and i used to play these legend games such as counter strike source generals zero hour grand theft auto sa minecraft and cs right after playing soccer with my old friends i will never ever forget those gold days,1
you cant use normal only widescreen normal is else to small or to big i find it annoying because im used to streched screen,0
insaaaaaaaaaaane game i grew up playing this game in cafe nets its definitely one of most influential fps games to exist and crazy enough still holds today no pay to win garbage just a fun v even better with friends you know an easy only downside is you cant add bots for some reason,1
why tf is hatsune miku,1

best game ever playing since,1
no one reads the comments so i will write that i am batman,1
aspect ratio issues broke the game which seems to have begun as of the hl anniversary update its in dire need of ui and better crosshair scaling options and for widescreen to be made more palatable,0
the game its fun the kids can play this game the people are toxicx they are hackers in this gamex you can make frends easy the game its easy to earn to play the game its old veteran players they still playing graphics of the game are badx the game its for bad pc and good some kids are toxic at this game,1
game was fun when i was like lol now many years later there are few servers to play in still packed but not fun levels just the same one over most on the global offensive and i liked the plane one with many more but no one plays em cheh,0

very good game,1
cant actually play a normal game of cs other than that its pretty good,1
you not him,1
this old game looks cool even if i play cs mainly i was suprised to see the skins lol my th game i saw sonic and an anime girl furry real a lot of fps of course duhh althought i always get my setting to reset whenever i restart so its a bit annoying and also i am not entierly fond of the server system and also idk what the new features are like you can legit resurect people what the hellll even in my keybind settings i cant find what key i have to press to do this xd but anyways good game you wont get lost if you play modern cs because well its the same maps and weapons like really and if you like archeology a bunch of old russiantalking people there you will like it even more btw when it says i recieved it for free i mean i got it with the other games in the years steam bundle,1

the game crashes constantly there is no implementation of bots you need to run some strange executable from the internet security warning if you want to install it yourself the game has serious problems if you feel like playing counterstrike but dont know where to start buy counterstrike condition zero its exactly the same game but with bots already implemented cool hostages and sounds corrected it has two versions in most maps original and the renewed one condition zero i like all versions i play counterstrike condition zero on manjaro linux using proton and it improve the game quality further by implementing antialiasing texture filtering and modern fonts in the main menu i do not recommend this version here it is very unstable go buy counterstrike condition zero,0

yes yes and yes the game literally gives you nostalgia just by saying cs ive played this game for about years unfortunately i never had money to buy it i would say this game is better then cs not by graphics obviously but by mechanics movement movement is the only thing that makes this game unique in its way i play this game now just because i want to bhop here shooting is special too you literally dont know when you are going to tap the person because the shooting is very weird this is the thing you need to work on a lot too spraying is not the key in this game you always need to go for taps unless you want to die this game gave me every emotion imaginable i found a lot of friends in this game cant let this game go anytime soon game rating,1

met the most beautiful person here good experience and community is really nice most of the time older players were usually really nice to younger newcomers to the game and that is really satisfying when there was the cheating thing i never really bothered that much the only thing i dislike is that you cant zoom with your weapon this game relays a lot on single play performance and that is not something i like too much not saying that the game is focused on performance of an individual but i always had feeling of a burden playing counter strike series most of the time being deadweight or the last person in the scoreboard which i never really hated never played source that much but overall very good experience i never understood the aiming still to this day favorite weapon obviously m people on servers hated me for shield playstyle best days gg the nickname even tho if i remember correctly the guys that gave me even said i should change it a little thanks for the times with the girl early in my childhood growing up,1

i am a yo father probably one of the oldest people playing this game i am a single father to my son who is now my son got this game for christmas in from his uncle so we installed it on his computer and he started playing by the end of the week he had hours on this game this was horrible for me as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son as he is always out with his friends or just watching youtube so i decided to make a steam account and get this game to see if i could maybe play alongside him i loaded into the game picked my character and world and started playing but i was stuck on what you where supposed to do i asked my son for help and he hosted a game for me to join i loved it as it was the best time i had spent with my son since my wife had died this game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well this game reminded me that theres fun to be had in everything and it has brought both me and my son many happy memories,1

starting as a mod for halflife cs had some key differences that made it stand out in competitive fps games at the time the modern settings when most fps games were science fantasy cs is strictly team based making communication and teamwork crucial no respawns during a round accentuated and intensified each encounter asymmetric objectives for the two teams prevented monotony purchasable equipment added a layer of strategy to the game beyond shooting players to score points,1
if ur tired of cs come back to and play cs,1
old school is the best,1

no good quality servers and most people are hackers or get a cracked version of the game and threaten to ddos you get cscz css or csgo because they have bots to play with if you cant even find a server might have been good years ago but now it has been left to rot,0

this game was my introduction the counterstrike franchise i still remember when i was years old we had something we called in egypt a cyber where the public were able to go in and enjoy a variety of computers there you could surf the internet play lan games multiplayer and everything you dreamed ofanyway there was this time where i was going through a tough time because i had trouble socializing and talking with others while my father was driving me around townwe came across a popular city cyber and he asked me if i wanted to go in and play some games until he would finish some business he had i said yes and went in all alone as i could hear kids my and around my age laugh and have fun playing lan games and etc so i quietly went into a lonely stallbooth and started a random computer where i played some games that i didnt really find any interest in until some kid looked a little older than me came and asked me if i would like to join their lan server in a game called counterstrike i said yes since i was happy i could finally meet new people and be a socializing kid he took a couple of minutes connecting me and setting up the server along side some of his friends i think our number was like and here it was counter strike my first ever map was csassault and oh boy was it fun he taught me the basic fundamentals of the game since it was my first time i obv sucked but nonetheless the core gameplay the conception and the guns it felt like i had finally found something i would thrive in and boil off some steam we played for a rough hour and this hour might have been the best hour in my life but unfortunately all good things must come to an end so after a little while we shook hands and we left never to see eachother again of course this wouldnt be the same for cs since after a while i managed to install the game on my old computer and was able to play the game i mostly preferred to play with bots but man you had no idea how good it felt coming back after a long day of school and blasting some terrorists with bots and playing in public community servers i also loved zombies and gun games and there was a time i was really good after a couple of years i was still very addicted and i managed to pick myself over the ground again and manage my life i continued to play the rest of the franchise all the way up to csgo in to whoever introduced me to this franchise and taught me the mechanics that one time in that one cyber thank you you are a legend,1

i am recommending this because of nostalgia if you are someone who has never played counterstrike i would have a tough time recommending this unless you want to check out where counterstrike got its roots from there are some things in this game that are somewhat anticompetitive like crouch walking some may call it silentstepping groundstrafing gstafing quickswitching to reload faster boosting people through roofs the insane amount of wall bangs you can do some do raise the skill cap where this game shined for me was the modding community and the custom game modes this is where kz started where surfing started where scoutzknivez started bhopping was around before counterstrike but counterstrike had bhop communities as well this is where weapon skins came from as modders would make custom models for weapons and custom player models this and counterstrike condition zero are the only counterstrike games to have a competitive knifing community because the knife mechanics were changed in other versions of counterstrike which made knifing noncompetitive you could get a headshot with a knife how could you not like that the graphics are definitely dated by todays standards and high fps with a high refresh rate monitor does not feel as smooth as in most modern fps games counterstrike has always been one of the best game series for the cost compared to what you get because of the communities and mods that sprung up around it counterstrike does not have a builtin matchmaking ladder like csgo this is the game that really accelerated the esports industry there has been so much esports history made in counterstrike the reason why steam was created in the first place was to give people a more efficient way of updating their games and a way to implement a cheating protection know as valve anticheat with counterstrike being the main focus,1
one of the best games i played since and still playing it,1

as a person from the balkans i can confirm this game is legit a part of our dna not too much to say here really it is without a doubt the greatest and most legendary fps game of all time certain aspects havent aged too well obviously but for an almost year old game that is still played by thousands of people every day it definitely deserves the praise it gets,1

yes,1
nice,1
no gun skins,1
og of all time cs forever,1
i swear this game is better than csgo and cs combined if they just updated this a little adding some of csgo features in it,1
been playing for more than years now despite what steam says and its still a great experience if you can find an alright server to play on mind you this isnt csgo with worse graphics so dont expect that players move differently weapons shoot differently et cetera cs is more individual oriented whereas csgo is more of a team game one big difference youll notice is people play this game to have fun if you lose no big deal theres no ranks no rising in ranks no dropping in ranks youre just here to have fun and thats okay but what the hell am i writing this for is there anyone out there who hasnt played this game i just wanted to leave a good review,1

what the fuck valve i got hacked by connecting to a game server,0
the legend the myth the best shooter,1
it is after more than decades still the best multiplayer game out there,1
this games public server browser experience is kinda booty ill be real stuff like the screenshake from shooting and scoping being heavily delayed are worsened with ping the awful crosshair the bad visibility and teams being hard to tell apart from a glance and the inability to find any nice vanilla servers to get a semi decent experience yeah this game is good when you can get a private game full of people but when it comes to public stuff im literally unable to play it well with the awful amount of spam fake servers and anything remotely okay being laggy as hell especially compared to css ontop of that the old cs fandom is a complete echochamber circlejerk about how anything new is horrible and how the good old days were so good and i wish i could go back i feel like so many of the people in this fandom are nostalgia obsessed has beens who cant let go of the past its so cancerous its awful enough with those people on source but in the general community its unbearable tldr games good w friendslan parties however its a severely worse scuffed experience if you dont have that given the serverbrowsers state,1

counter strike is one of the best fps games ever i think that being such a simple game is what makes it so good the only detail i see is that there are no longer as many servers or players as before and many players have gone to other games but still continues to maintain its active player base obviously no longer as in its golden age,1

counterstrike is a classic firstperson shooter game that has stood the test of time the games simple mechanics tight map design and intense gameplay make it a mustplay for any fan of the genre the game features a wide array of weapons each with its own unique strengths and weaknesses ensuring dynamic gameplay the graphics may be outdated by todays standards but the games legacy lives on through the competitive esports scene that still exists to this day overall counterstrike is an influential game that remains enjoyable even after all these years,1

this game is good i havent played that much right now but it feels like counter strike yes it does feel like a year old game because it is a year old game but thats part of the charm of cs it also goes on sale for so you might as well pick this one up,1
very communityoriented cs is still lacking in its community made content but it is slowly getting there cs fills that gap nicely especially for those who are looking to get that feeling of nostalgia or are into old games in general having said that the shooting is very different from the sourcesource engine games it is much more skillrequired than the source counterstrikes as it punishes even the slightest of mistakes or inaccuracies if youre of the run and gun variety and your favorite weapon in cs was the mp or p this gamell give you a reality check,1

came back to after few hours of playing cs had fun on csassault destorm deaztec asoilrig something cs probably will never have this game aged well the only bad side is that there too much russians,1
while at first glance this game may look old it hasnt aged at all this game feels the exact same as it did back in i can honestly say that this game has stood the test of time better than any other game i can think of this is the king of all competitive fps games it may have been dethroned when csgo was released in but this game will never truly die even if the day comes when there are zero servers this game will still be alive it will be alive in the hearts and souls of all of those players who have had the joy of discovering and playing this game over the last years and counting even today in north america you can find competitive pick up games sure it might be with people who dont speak your language and some people may cheat or leave early but its doable and if you happen to live in europe there is still an active competitive community over there there arent many players left but there are players and this game is an absolute gem i would recommend this game even today due to the extremely high quality and most of all fair mechanics this game offers,1
gud,1

best game ever no gimmicks no bs just fun best fps experience and gaming experiences this and counterstrikecondition zero back in its hay day these games shaped my whole teenage adolescence the nights of toonami on tv and counterstrike are some of the best memories i can remember as part of my gaming career god i miss superhero mod warcraft mod and pokemod the amount of mods and creativity you can do with this game and maps made by nipper and passionate other map creators really carried this game from just obscure fps to extraordinary sadly most these things now are locked behind the gate of time those who experienced these things that made the game from just a first person shooter to a god game status will be treasured for the remainder of their lives unfortunately these teachings will be lost to time its very sad most people will never get to see it at its peak its literally one of the games where you had to be there to understand what you missed a fantastic experience you probably wont have i cant not recommend this game its just the best game ive ever played hands down,1

nothing quite like growing up in the s and watching my older brother play cs on the old servers before steam dropped everything changed in when steam dropped man this game crafted my childhood deathrun jailbreak ruinning scrims and surfing what a time to be alive the superhero mods were insane as well karoadwarsv surfski hp and so many more iconic maps,1

i am years old my exwife and i have a daughter together and we adopted our son together both are now years old when we were going through our separation i felt lost and unhappy i was selfdestructive one day i was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that i punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion this resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right handthe hand i worked with played games with and used to carry my children to bedthe hand i desperately needed to ensure i could continue providing upon learning the severity of the selfinflicted damage i became almost suicidal keep in mind that just a few months before this i was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety i had never experienced anger outbursts nor was i the type to break down and cry but i was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side with nothing better to do i looked for a game i could play with one hand while recovering somehow i stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments i decided it was worth a try i must admit i didnt beat the game nor did i play as much as some of you in fact i may have played this game for only a day or two that being said after doing so i had a new joy and hope for life i managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me i could experience the joy and happiness of other people i relaxed for minutes listening to this music long enough to realize that i would be okay after realizing this i turned off the game and went back to work my hand hurt a lot but i was motivated i stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father i needed to be at that moment not the weak boy i was behaving like today i am close friends with the mother of my children we dont fight argue or say hurtful things to each other we are parents and friends now i have children my third child is wait also years old the woman i am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each others lives we have been dating for a year and are very happy together moral of the story you never know what life has in store for you and if i had given up when all odds were against me i wouldnt be where i am today this silly little game helped me realize that thank you,1
i played for not even an hour and i like this game,1
bif you are looking for a review of this game you have come to the wrong place but instead here i have some interesting banana facts that you will most certainly appreciateb bfact number b ia banana is a berry not a fruit this is because botanically a berry contains seeds inside the flesh not outsidei bfact number b ibanana does not grow on a tree but on an herb a trees stem is made of wood unlike the bananas which is made of fibersi bfact number b ibananas are sterile you cant sow seeds and grow them bananas are grown by cutting a piece from another plant sort of cloning which means the banana you are eating today is genetically the same as the banana your grandfather atei bfact number b ibananas have been cultivated for the past years or so in southeast asia from there it moved to west asia and africai bfact number b iin all likelihood bananas were first cultivated not as food but as source of fibers that were treated and made into clothi bfact number b iportuguese colonizers introduced bananas to the americas however europeans should thank french writer jules verne for introducing them to the fruit verne was ecstatic about bananas in his book around the world in eighty daysi bfact number b ibananas are radioactive they contain small amounts of the isotope potassium but for the radiation to be harmful you need to eat close to bananas daily for over yearsi bfact number b ibananas are in fact good for you it fights depression cures headaches and helps in weightloss banana skins are used to treat insect bites bananas are rich in vitamin c antioxidants calcium and folic acidi bfact number b ithe term banana republic was coined to describe central american countries that depended on one single export bananas and were controlled by foreign businesses in this case american these countries were usually run by corrupt dictatorsi bfact number b ithe popular dessert banana split was invented in by a yearold american pharmacist david evans strickler in pennsylvaniai,1

we can say thats this game never gets old it was better then csgo almost everywhere unfortunetly so as csgo became popular entire community in became worse loads of community servers are fulfilled by ridiculous csgo like features still the community is way wiser and overall better but the game is not that good as it used to be,0

its a solid game but in terms of very active playerbase it is very much dead besides the few diehard fans respect to them,1
i am writing a review based on the present tense because if you judge not in this time then it is not clear why i do not recommend this game after all it is a thrill for those who play or played these games before i am not one of those people this game is like new for me that is i am playing it for the first time i do not recommend it because it does not have very convenient management in view of csgo after all i am sure that the whole association can be connected with her isnt it in short i didnt really enjoy this initial series,0
not able to play with bots,0
i am years old been playing cs since at least era when i was or was even on a traveling cs team back in the day,1

i dont know what it is but i actually prefer the shooting mechanics of the original compared to the more recent editions its just smoother and more rewarding than anything that has come after it even despite the limitations of the engine im personally more of a fan of the runandgun types of shooters such as xonotic not on steam im aware that this type of gameplay was not the design goal of counterstrike but even so i seem to enjoy playing the goldsource games more than their newer counterparts theyre just more fun,1

when it comes to firstperson shooters there are few games that are iconic as counterstrike released in the game has been played by millions of people around the world and is still going strong today while the game may be years old it still has a large and active player base thanks to its simple but addictive gameplay if youre looking for a fastpaced shooter with plenty of action counterstrike is a good place to start,1

once upon a time in the early days of pc gaming a small group of modders had a crazy idea they believed in a world where terrorists and counterterrorists could engage in a battle of wits reflexes and all the gunfire you could handle without leaving the safety of your desk chair and so in the late s they gave birth to a phenomenon we now know as counterstrike the game was in a way like your grandmas famous stew a little bit of this a dash of that and a whole lot of secret sauce it was pure magic wrapped in pixelated graphics and the occasional i cant believe you just shot me rage but it was love at first sight for many you could choose to be a terrorist or a counterterrorist wielding all sorts of weapons and striving to complete objectives or eliminate the enemy team as the years went by counterstrike evolved much like your teenage years it got a little smarter a bit more mature and much better at killing terrorists and defusing bombs there were new maps new weapons and of course endless arguments about which gun was the best spoiler it was always the awp it was a mix of strategy teamwork and well a fair amount of camping in dark corners but it was in when things got a bit more global counterstrike global offensive or csgo burst onto the scene it was like counterstrike had put on a fancy suit polished its shoes and gotten a promotion csgo brought better graphics improved gameplay mechanics and more matchmaking options the esports scene exploded turning the game into a major league of its own it was like the super bowl for gamers but with fewer commercials and more headshots yet as time went on csgo started showing its age like that old sitcom you used to bingewatch in your pajamas fans clamored for something new something fresh something with a at the end of it and valve the brilliant minds behind counterstrike heard their pleas thus counterstrike was born the sequel took everything we loved about csgo sprinkled in some futuristic tech and voil it was as if the old dog had learned some new tricks the graphics were out of this world and the gameplay was smoother than a jazz solo but at its core it remained the counterstrike we all knew and loved with the release of counterstrike csgo was officially retired a hero riding into the sunset leaving behind an indelible legacy in the gaming world it was a bittersweet moment for fans like saying goodbye to an old friend but as they loaded up counterstrike and heard that familiar dun dun dun dun of the menu music they knew the journey was far from over counterstrike was here to stay evolving and adapting just like the gamers who loved it so whether youre a seasoned veteran or a freshfaced recruit in the world of counterstrike remember that this game isnt just about shooting terrorists and defusing bombs its about friendships forged in the heat of battle memories made in the dust of dedust and countless hours spent wondering why the guy on your team insists on buying a negev every round heres to counterstrike past present and future a game that keeps on giving just like a good stew recipe thats passed down through the generations,1

in its day cs was the shining example of a multiplayer fps experience it was just one of those games that if you didnt own it you were just statistically worse than everyone else oh how the might have fallen nowadays the game is plagued with a general lack of interest as most of its fans have moved on to its vastly superior brothers css and csgo and for good reason i would recommend playersonly play on servers they trust this is because apparently one server overwrote all of my unused keys to connect to xddmsshadowro which is also a server i would recommend avoiding at all costs this game is a relic a fossil from an age of gaming long past,0

ultimate classic that still holds up today counterstrike is an alltime classic and one of the first games that i owned and played on my steam account i even bought it boxed and with that started my journey on steam counterstrike is a simple yet so fun game you choose a team in which your objectives vary you can play as terrorists or counterterrorists as terrorists you keep and defend hostages place bombs at specific sites and prevent the counterterrorists from defusing them as counterterrorists you try to save the hostages and defuse the bombs that terrorist have placed meanwhile you pump each other full of lead i especially liked the vip mode in which one player is appointed as a target that will win the round if eliminated the other players on your team need to defend you with their lives until the time is up to win it is a unique and fun experience that was most fun at lan parties when starting the round you choosebuy your weapons you can choose a variety of pistols submachine guns heavy assault rifles sniper rifles and grenades some weapons work better for you than others so half the fun is trying to figure out which weapon has the right feeling and handling for you the weapons themselves however are well balanced and i did not experience any unfair advantages with a specific weapon the graphics in counterstrike are really nice for the time they are well rendered and textured and the frame rate is spot on no tearing no lag it runs smooth as butter the animations are stiff and when killed you drop dead as a brick but this the charm that the game has in terms of sound this game nails it especially for the time period guns sound aggressive and loud and explosions can be felt through your headset it is spot on and holds up great with todays standards the controls are easy to learn and work fluent and responsive my only problem at the time with counterstrike was the limited time to choose your gear before the round starts it is completely logical that players do not wait until everyone choose their shiny guns but when first playing i was still checking what weapon would be best for me and before i knew it i had forty holes in me but like with many other first person shooters especially online i just need to git gut i still cherish the memories of this game at the many lan parties i attended to the pure joy tension and competitive game play that had this unique experience back then the thrill when you finally blow someone up with a well lobbed grenade the satisfaction when you finally sent a successful sniper bullet through someones skull it was just amazing counterstrike will always be one of my favorite online shooters today the upgraded counterstrike source introduces new graphics and an even smoother experience however counterstrike will always remain an alltime gem that can be played any time when i am feeling old i just play this version over the source remake or global offensive just for good old times definitely recommend this timeless relic,1

dont play unless you have a bucket of bolts pc held together with a few twigs and the occasional piece of twine to bind the edges only functional due to the dead spider and rat souls that are trapped in your cpu and the prayers and tears you have forced out to get it to work if so the game is fun with friends online servers are weird dont recommend pretty fun on touchpad takes at least ten hours to get used to thoughi played like maps you can get online are best for smaller groups buy on sale otherwise dont the game is literally older than most children,1

a cs classic and the best cs game ever to be released one of the best games ever fullstop a good graphic design for its time coupled with online player vs player experience are nothing short of revolutionary the fact that there are still players fully engaged in this game that was released years ago speaks for itself if youve never tried it and you want to see csgo and cs origins i gladly recommend playing cs,1

this game is nostalgia and i love paying it,1
wall banging lyfe,1
one of the best games of our childhood i dont think that there will be any other iconic and greatest game like cs,1
first shooter on pc that got me into fps gaming will never get tired of this valve masterpiece,1
your mom probably would enjoy this kids everyone everyone except kids casual players pro players people who plan to take one game and make it their life potato really bad bad bad but playable ok good beautiful masterpiece free buy now worth the price wait for sale maybe if you have some spare money left do not buy it do not throw money into a trash can s pc minimum medium high end nasa computer you just need arms easy easy to learn hard to master average depends on the difficulty set not recommended for beginners hard dark souls only the best of the best can complete this game grind nothing only if you care about leaderboardsranks isnt necessary to progress average grind level a bit grindysometimes go back to the last village and shoot some more scarecrows practically a full time job only gameplay doesnt include a story there is a story but most of the game is focused on gameplay better than nothing i suppose average decent amazing fantastic game itself is one big bug bugs destroying the game lot of bugs few bugs you can use them for speedrun nothing ive seen long enough for a cup of tea short not too short depends on you long very long endless better than mobile one long tedious grind fun at first but gets old quick consistently fun cant stop playing even though i should be finished my favourite game is counter strike global offensive i have so many hours on it almost too many and i thought about trying the game that started it all aside from halflife since it was on sale for a few bucks it was terrible so what do i think i know the game is almost years old as of writing this so i will give it the benefit of the doubt im sure valve doesnt care one bit about keeping the community alive for this game but it is almost unplayable sure there is some nostalgia for those that played it back in the day but you are way better off just playing csgo nowadays if you enjoy a stable game there arent any bugs or anything as valve has always been pretty consistent with keeping a game in good shape but the gameplay is pretty subpar for i know counter strike was just coming on to the scene that call of duty would soon overtake but it plays like doom from the s in my opinion but hackers are what ruin the game it is downright unplayable because of how bad the aimbotting flying wallhacking instakilling and many more hacks have gotten if you load into a game you will not get a single kill even if this game becomes free at any point do not get it it will just waste your storage space that could be used for playable games but props to valve for evolving from this mess into the csgo we love today,0
its counter strike broo u cant say its bad never say it to anyone,1
get the bot mod then you can really experience the game spoilers spoiler if you play with bots turn on friendly fire and shoot at your friendly bots ensure they die you will notice a very interesting result i had not remembered before with the bots they explode in anger spoiler,1

very good gamevery nostalgic,1
one of the most nostalgic ever of my life,1
classic we are waiting for cs,1
full of bugs,1
from the visual outset the concept of nostalgia seems obvious you see a game you played as a kidor a game that looks like one you played as a kidso it triggers happy memories,1
my first love,1
honestly a very classic game however there is one extreme downside to it theres no bots thats right a counterstrike game with no bots what is this without any bots to play against you can really only play against players and thats nearly impossible at this point due to how old this game is and the little community that it has this game doesnt get many players meaning its almost impossible to actually play it unless you stay in a multiplayer server by yourself for hours and hours until someone actually joins if the developers add bots ill replay the game and edit my review accordingly i do recommend this game but my experience has just not been positive due to the fact that theres nobody to play this game with making this game basically turn into a walk around and shoot stuff and do nothing else simulator if this game had fully integrated bots in the base game it would be much more playable and longerlasting,0
brings so many childhood memories the nostalgia its a bliss to be a part of such a legendary title that gave birth to the fps genere,1
good for oldschool gaming enthusiasts its great for its time,1
aim so good i got banned on a server,1
one of the best,1

h is counterstrike global offensive worth to buy h b yes b ieven if you are not really into the shooter genre csgo is probably the best game to get things started not only does it have a huge variety in game modes and also community mods it is the best game to reach a decent aim you can profit from in other shootersi h what mods can you play in csgo h ithere are plenty the mods variety is huge i really have not played a lot of mods since i am more into the competetive counterstrike but i for example played zombiemods hungergamesmods surf maps with and without rpg mod bunnyhop and awpnoscope bbutb there are many more mods to that h what are the key aspects of the game h list casual bombhostage maps demolition bomb maps gungame deathmatch competitive matchmaking list bucasualub iin casual play mode you will basicly spawn every round life per round and fight agains the opposite team vs you can play either bomb maps where you have to plantdefuse a bomb or hostage maps where you have to defend hostages or rescue them you can choose between the official competetive map pool which does not include hostage maps or reserve group where you have both types you will usually spawn with kevlarhelmet and defuse kit not on hostage mapsi budemolitionub iin demolition play mode you play v on small bomb maps and you also have only one live you spawn with kevlarhelmet and a weapon that will change ever round where you have killed an enemy grenades if you make multiple kills the same roundi bugungameub iin gungame play mode you will play v on small gungame maps where you have to kill an enemy with a preset weapon everyone starts with the same weapons once you killed two enemies you will progress to the next weapon you win after you reached knife level and killed a player with the golden knife b noteb every player must go through the same exact weapons to win and the weapons are randomizedi budeathmatchub iin deathmatch play mode you will play v on the same maps as on casual play mode you will spawn with the weapons you choose through the buymenu kevlarhelmet are already purchased for you you have multiple lives and can always change your weapons after you died one game ends after minutes and the winner with the highest score wins you gain points by killing enemies or assist in killing them or by killing chickens which gives point only per chickeni bucompetitive matchmakingub iin competitive play mode you will basicly play like casual but different you will play v with people of your same skillgroup on the same maps as on casual you can choose specific maps if you want to get serious with counterstrike this will be the game mode you are looking for but keep in mind that you need a lot of knowledge about the game for this type of play mode and you need at least community rank to play competitivei b note b spoiler keep in mind that the game changes a lot so do the game modes i wrote this so any changes after i probably did not predict spoiler code so all in all counterstrike is at the moment my favorite shooter since all others even new ones like rainbow six siege are not as much fun as counterstrike is especially the competitive aspect of the game is way better than others code quotewolfreflexxxi strikehope thisstrike helped you quote,0

cs is good,1
only played csgo before thisplay consoles primarily so maybe i just suckpotato internetusually run deaths and kills playing other mp gamesran deaths and kills in the matches i played this some of the spawns are complete garbage the spreads on guns are ridiculous even after analyzing recoil patterns and burst firing too many variables to consider when it comes to firefights that arent explained at all to even know if it was your fault you died or if you just got hit by lag this is one of those games im sure runs flawless over lan or with an optimal internet connection but is really frustratingbecause its impossible to tell if its a user error to get through when your aiming at an enemies head fire and the bullet goes completely off courseunless its a sniper considering range and the weapon at optimal range the second bullet in a burst could be an inch off to ft away from where you were aiming when playing this i feel like a nerd with no upper body strength or cardio who always misses leg day thrown into a battlefield with little to no experience even though i have fired multiple weapons in real life feels like a bit too much is up to luck to fully enjoy but i do like how chaotic it is and thats enough to keep me coming back for a random mp match here or there servers are very active for a game with this age with all that said i havent played a traditional hostage match yet just tdm and ffa but everything feels surprisingly slow and inaccurate when im not immediately dying which may work for sloower traditional more strategic based modes where you have the time and space to react in a controlled manner while coordinating with other team mates but feels like im carrying a sack of potatoes while trying to smoke a blunt playing tdm and ffa i must hone the irishrussian stoner in me to git gud,1

counterstrike originally released in as a halflife mod and later as a standalone game remains a timeless classic that laid the foundation for the entire firstperson shooter genre its straightforward yet intensely competitive gameplay has kept players coming back for more than two decades at its core counterstrike is a teambased tactical shooter that pits terrorists against counterterrorists in a series of objectivebased rounds the gameplay is remarkably simple eliminate the opposing team or complete mission objectives however this simplicity is deceptive as counterstrike excels in its execution the games weapon mechanics are precise and unforgiving rewarding accuracy and strategy over runandgun tactics the balance of weapons and equipment adds depth to the gameplay allowing players to develop their own styles and strategies every shot counts and mastering recoil patterns becomes an essential skill counterstrikes maps are iconic offering a variety of settings and scenarios that cater to different playstyles whether its a closequarters firefight in dust or a tense hostage rescue in office each map offers a unique and challenging experience the balance between terrorists and counterterrorists ensures that matches are often close and competitive one of counterstrikes standout features is its emphasis on teamwork and communication cooperation is crucial for success and the games lack of regenerating health or respawns heightens the tension the need for precise coordination and strategy has made it a favorite among esports players and teams the games longevity is a testament to its enduring appeal over the years counterstrike has received numerous updates and iterations with counterstrike global offensive csgo being the most recent and popular the community has played a significant role in shaping the games evolution through mods maps and custom content however its important to note that the original counterstrike can feel dated compared to its successors in terms of graphics and user interface the games visuals while serviceable do not match the standards of modern titles additionally new players may find the learning curve steep as the game does not hold your hand and demands patience and practice to excel in summary counterstrike is a genredefining classic that continues to be celebrated for its simplicity competitiveness and emphasis on teamwork its enduring popularity and influence on the firstperson shooter genre are a testament to its quality while it may show its age in certain aspects counterstrike remains a mustplay for fans of tactical shooters and competitive gaming,1

this is where it all started memories of my childhood started with just playing a cracked version of counter strike and flash games still using windows xp at the time the internet was really slow and you couldnt really do much on a pc besides playing the games that game with it you would be lucky to find more games in the hard drive this was also the time where youtube was at its infancy i would remember watching a lot of stick figure on crack videos i would always remember the time where things were just perfect it was a simpler time back then and now here i am finally purchased an official copy of counter strike and the nostalgia was still there a very timeless evergreen game that have already imprinted on my memories as one of the best that ever happened during my entire life i would like to thank for the existence of this simple fps shooter game that started it all alongside need for speed underground ddr and warcraft iii,1

counterstrike is without a doubt one of the most battletested and refined games in the history of firstperson shooters over two decades after its initial release it remains the goto for anyone seeking a tactical and competitive experience released back in counterstrike didnt just bring us into the world of strategic teambased gameplayit defined it the games blend of fastpaced action and strategic depth has not only aged well but continues to set the bar for competitive shooters its the granddaddy of them all but this granddad is still hitting the gym and challenging the younger generation to keep up the gameplay is as sharp as ever every round in counterstrike is a highstakes adrenalinepumping affair where precision timing and teamwork are key whether youre planting bombs rescuing hostages or just trying to stay alive the intensity never fades the graphics might not compare to the eyepopping visuals of modern titles but the minimalistic design is a testament to its era focusing purely on gameplay over flashy visuals what truly stands out is how well counterstrike has maintained its relevance the community around the game is still thriving proving that even without the bells and whistles of modern engines or highend graphics quality gameplay shines through even today its influence is felt across many modern shooters making it a classic thats still in active play so if youre looking for a game thats as challenging as it is rewarding and you dont mind a bit of a retro feel counterstrike is still worth your time whether youre a veteran or a newcomer theres something timeless about jumping into a match and testing your skills in a game thats been honing its craft for over two decades,1
the original counterstrike is an absolute classic and you can still buy it and play it today,1

much better than cs,1
this is one of the first games i played as a kid during mid s i sure had fun playing it initially but this cs game style never really grew on me eventually i moved on to shooters like cod cod and later on and i enjoyed them much more primarily because they were faster paced and movement was much more fluid i can definitely understand how majority of people love this game they enjoyed it as a kid and just kept playing back in the day it was extremely popular and probably the best multiplayer shooter out there countless lans were held and it was beginning of esports era however if you take off your nostalgia glasses you have to see that cs is today outdated in almost every single aspect i cant really recommend this game to new players that never played it before id suggest maybe to try css or csgo which will be much more enjoyable than for new players,0
cs has outlived csgo based,1

my name is walter hartwell white i live at negra arroyo lane albuquerque new mexico this is my confession if youre watching this tape im probably dead murdered by my brotherinlaw hank schrader hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist shortly after my th birthday hank came to me with a rather shocking proposition he asked that i use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world connections that he made through his career with the dea i was astounded i i always thought that hank was a very moral man and i was thrown confused but i was also particularly vulnerable at the time something he knew and took advantage of i was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family hank took me on a ride along and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make and i was weak i didnt want my family to go into financial ruin so i agreed every day i think back at that moment with regret i quickly realized that i was in way over my head and hank had a partner a man named gustavo fring a businessman hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man and when i tried to quit fring threatened my family i didnt know where to turn eventually hank and fring had a falling out from what i can gather hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business to which fring flatly refused to give him and things escalated fring was able to arrange uh i guess i guess you call it a hit on my brotherinlaw and failed but hank was seriously injured and i wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over upon recovery hank was bent on revenge working with a man named hector salamanca he plotted to kill fring and did so in fact the bomb that he used was built by me and he gave me no option in it i have often contemplated suicide but im a coward i wanted to go to the police but i was frightened hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the albuquerque dea and about that time to keep me in line he took my children from me for months he kept them my wife who up until that point had no idea of my criminal activities was horrified to learn what i had done why hank had taken our children we were scared i was in hell i hated myself for what i had brought upon my family recently i tried once again to quit to end this nightmare and in response he gave me this i cant take this anymore i live in fear every day that hank will kill me or worse hurt my family i all i could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man for what he really is,1

i am a yo father probably one of the oldest people playing this game i am a single farther to my son who is now my son got this game for christmas in from his uncle so we installed it on his computer and he started playing by the end of the week he had hours on this game this was horrible for me as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son as he is always out with his friends or just watching youtube so i decided to make a steam account and get this game to see if i could maybe play alongside him i loaded into the game picked my character and started playing but i was stuck on what you where supposed to do i asked my son for help and he hosted a game for me to join i loved it as it was the best time i had spent with my son since my wife had died this game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well this game reminded me that theres fun to be had in everything and it has brought both me and my son many happy memories,1

let me start off by saying this back when this game was new popular and all i would reccomend it hands down but the fact that you cant play with bots is devastating if you are playing this game right now so that means you will have to play on servers but right now most of the servers are completely empty and that renders the game almost impossible to play so i reccommend you get any of the other cs games this game is just too dead to reccomend,0

i live in the american gardens building on west st street on the th floor my name is patrick bateman im years old i believe in taking care of myself in a balanced diet in a rigorous exercise routine in the morning if my face is a little puffy ill put on an icepack while doing my stomach crunches i can do a thousand now after i remove the icepack i use a deeppore cleanser lotion in the shower i use a wateractivated gel cleanser then a honeyalmond bodyscrub and on the face an exfoliating gelscrub then i apply an herb mint facial masque which i leave on for ten minutes while i prepare the rest of my routine i always use an aftershave lotion with little or no alcohol because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look older then moisturizer then an antiaging eye balm followed by a final moisturizing protective lotion there is an idea of a patrick bateman some kind of abstraction but there is no real me only an entity something illusory and though i can hide my cold gaze and you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping yours and maybe you can even sense our life styles are probably comparable i simply am not there,1

i am a year old father probably one of the oldest people playing this game i am a single father raising my son who is now years old my son won this game from his uncle so we installed him on his computer and he started playing until the end of the week he had hours in this game this was horrible for me because it was hard to find ways to spend time with my son because he is always with friends or just watching youtube so i decided to do a steam account and get this game to see if i could play beside him i bought the game chose my skin and world and started playing but i was stuck in what you should do i asked my son for help and he organized a game for me to participate i loved it because it was the best time i spent with my son since my wife died since then this game has approached me and my son again and now we spend time together away from home as well this game reminded me that there is fun in everything and i brought many happy memories to me and my son,1

still a masterpiece its insane how after all these years this halflife mod turned full game is still so damn fun great sound design low latency challenging mechanics good hitreg and amazing movement i really wish the modern cs titles had the same low stamina cost and crisp feeling of the movement in this game even if its still fun and maybe more balanced in cs like crouch jumping onto a crate is instant and it just feels right and bhopping is super easy compared to cs walls are also paperthinin this game but i love that and i feel like if you cant shoot through concrete you cant call yourself a rifle most guns in reality can shoot through concrete easily even still you dont take full damage from wallbangs and you really got ta line yourself up so id say its balanced he grenades damaging through walls and wallbangs make the game function surprisingly well even without molotovs or modern grenade lineups the more i play this game the more i understand why so many players keep saying they miss or think its better than go or its still distinctly counterstrike without all the bs that would later come like skins which includes renting them which is just such a cs thing ingame gambling and restricting choosing your own character models plus the amount of mods you can put on this game is another major pro compared to the modern cs titles you can turn this shit into csgo or valorant with a few steps just check on youtube the only mods i feel are necessities would be installing bots and exploding headshot both of which you can find on gamebananacom anything else is a bonus in my opinion and free overall i will concede that cs and csgo are more balanced and accessible and are generally taking the franchise further in a better direction dedicated matchmaking more accurate weapons more viable weapons smokes actually obstructing vision crossmap grenade lineups and more are all things this franchise has improved on over the years and things cs features however being the diehard fan that i am of counterstrike there is no surprise to me that this game still gets k players after all these years later you cant kill whats already a masterpiece long live,1

counterstrike review counterstrike one of the most iconic fps games ever remains a classic even after two decades whether youre a casual player or a hardcore gamer cs has carved out a place in gaming history lets dive into why this game has such legendary status gameplay cs offers simple but intense teambased action players join either the terrorists or counterterrorists with the primary objective to either plant the bomb or defuse it depending on your team theres also a hostage rescue mode which adds extra variety to the missions what makes cs so engaging is its high skill ceiling from learning the maps to perfecting your aim theres always something to improve movement and shooting require mastery and the rush of landing a perfect headshot never gets old graphics okay lets be honest by todays standards the graphics are dated however for its time early s cs s visuals were sharp and functional the textures may look blocky but the simplicity helped keep the focus on pure skill and gameplay besides the nostalgia factor plays a huge part here many players grew up with these visuals and the blocky environments are part of the charm maps and weapons maps like dedust and deinferno are legendary and still used in modern tournaments the layouts are balanced and require strategic team play whether its finding the perfect camping spot or rushing to plant the bomb the map design is topnotch weapons range from pistols to machine guns each with its own recoil patterns and tactics the ak and ma are favorites but dont underestimate the power of the awp sniper rifle for longrange domination community and mods one of the key reasons cs has stayed relevant is the community players have created countless mods maps and skins keeping the game fresh even today from zombie mods to custom servers the flexibility in usercreated content makes the game infinitely replayable also playing with friends or on public servers is a unique experience full of surprises and fun moments competitive scene cs practically invented the esports fps scene while the game has been replaced by counterstrike global offensive cs in major tournaments still has a dedicated following and its own local tournaments watching or playing in a competitive match feels intense and strategicwhere every bullet counts conclusion even after all these years counterstrike is a testament to what makes a game truly great simple mechanics an engaging community and skillbased gameplay whether youre returning for nostalgia or discovering it for the first time cs still packs a punch final verdict timeless classic that shaped the fps genre,1
good game,1
got a cat here friends passing by can touch her and click like to pet her once award for good luck take my points for infinite pets l x,1
i never got this game early but it is fun but the graphics and gameplay slowly die down and get outdated as the years go by i see how this use to be fun in the day but im use to modern shooters and think its outdated,0
it was my childhood well worth the time spent even before steam appeared played halflife cs cs the hrs on steam is nothing if i add up all the hrs outside steam having own my own servers with at least players nonstop on servers paid domains etc forums websites deditated to it so yea i guess i also made others play and get involved in it,1
i like the game but i got easly bored,1
epic game would reccomend picked up this game on sale for like bucks and a bunch of other sexy games do yourself a favour and wait for steam sale and get some great valve games,1

ha timeless classic counterstrike reviewh brating b counterstrike stands as a testament to the enduring allure of a game that has not only shaped an entire genre but also left an indelible mark on the gaming landscape as one of the most iconic firstperson shooters ever created cs has captivated players for decades with its strategic gameplay intense action and communitydriven spirit from the moment you enter the gritty world of counterstrike youre immediately immersed in a heartpounding experience that demands tactical prowess and quick reflexes the games mechanics are elegantly simple yet incredibly deep fostering a gameplay loop that is easy to learn but difficult to master the balance between counterterrorists and terrorists each with distinct objectives and weaponry keeps matches engaging and varied graphically counterstrike might show its age compared to modern titles but its charm lies in its straightforward visual design the simplicity of the maps and character models contributes to the games accessibility allowing players to focus solely on gameplay without distractions plus its low system requirements mean that even today a wide range of players can enjoy the thrill of cs on various hardware setups what truly sets counterstrike apart is its vibrant and tightknit community the games popularity has led to a dedicated player base that continues to host servers create mods and organize tournaments the sense of camaraderie within the community is palpable making cs not just a game but a shared experience that transcends time the core gameplay modes such as bomb defusal and hostage rescue offer a level of tension that few other games can match every round is a highstakes battle of wits where cooperation communication and individual skill intertwine to create moments of pure exhilaration while newer iterations of the counterstrike series have introduced refinements and innovations cs remains the purest embodiment of the franchises essence in conclusion counterstrike is an absolute masterpiece that has stood the test of time its simple yet profound mechanics combined with its passionate community make it an experience that transcends generations even in the face of modern gaming advancements cs continues to remind us why classic games hold an irreplaceable space in the hearts of gamers whether youre a longtime fan or a curious newcomer stepping into the world of counterstrike is a journey well worth taking,1

to fix c error on launching right click counterstrike click properties click betas and change none to beta beta now you can launch the game alernatively you can download halflife from steam store now free do the same thing to get to the betas page as described above select steamlegacy preth anniversary build now cs should launch note that you only need to perform one of the above methods to launch the game,1

are you tired of life school or that youve just lost times in a row in csgo comp well if so why not just chillax and go back to the early days when shit wasnt so serious and is actually more fun and stress free a good old cs can sometimes be great fun this game is basically the foundation of many games mainly csgo and valorant originally a mod for halflife this game is my childhood playing it after school and just not overthinking about life cs is like a time travel just click play and youre put back intoto the early days have fun,1

truly a classic game but unfortunately it ruined pc gaming by being too good was the pinnacle of competitive gaming and esports the addition of steam and update was still a very solid game but it spelled the end of an era and led us on the path of the source engine which ruined pc gaming no game has ever come close to the magic of and the lingering residue of its greatness continues to attract new players to the franchise despite the later entries being soulless shadows of the original,1
very good very naice,1
i think the nostalgia of this game is beautiful but i would have to say that this game is honestly not worth it because of all of the people who are either pros or cheaters consequently the game is unplayable admittedly i am a noob but irrespective of what server i connect to there is pretty much no chance i can have any fun sometimes it really feels like they have to be using some kind of aimbot or something theres just no way they arent cheating maybe to give them the benefit of the doubt you could say they have been playing this game for the better part of years even still the servers are all over saturated with such players who just dont let amateur players like me have any chance which is surely a real shame if we cant experience a masterpiece like this without having our experience completely ruined i dont mind losing but it is really frustrating when you get killed every time you peek a corner or try to attack the enemy nevermind how careful you are how well armoured you are regardless you will get killed in a fraction of a second what kind of bullshit is that im going to try cs source to see if it is any better with this game the only fun you can have is to connect to an empty server that has bots but that of course gets really boring quite fast,0

one of the best an iconic game that has stood the test of time and continues to be beloved by players of all ages from its engaging gameplay and strategic mechanics to the tightknit community of friendly players this game truly offers a unique and immersive experience i have been playing counterstrike since childhood and it never fails to bring back nostalgic memories and provide endless hours of entertainment the graphics may be a bit outdated compared to newer games but the gameplay is where counterstrike truly shines the balance between terrorists and counterterrorists the variety of weapons and maps and the teamwork required to succeed all contribute to its enduring popularity whether youre sneaking around corners trying to outsmart your opponents or engaging in intense firefights every match is an sexy thrill ride long live counterstrike the game that will always have a special place in my heart and the hearts of gamers around the world thank you for the memories the friendships and the endless fun cs forever,1

this was one of the best first person shooter and fps games after steam updated the fpsengine and made other changes to the game after more than years of good gameplay i would rather say that this is a now a ripoff the game doesnt work properly and the developers isnt listening to the players when theyre updating the game if steam would roll back the game to before they update i would recommend this game because of the good gameplay at the moment because of the update i just want my money back,0

my name is walter hartwell white i live at negra arroyo lane albuquerque new mexico this is my confession if youre watching this tape im probably dead murdered by my brotherinlaw hank schrader hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist shortly after my th birthday hank came to me with a rather shocking proposition he asked that i use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world connections that he made through his career with the dea i was astounded i i always thought that hank was a very moral man and i was thrown confused but i was also particularly vulnerable at the time something he knew and took advantage of i was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family hank took me on a ride along and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make and i was weak i didnt want my family to go into financial ruin so i agreed every day i think back at that moment with regret i quickly realized that i was in way over my head and hank had a partner a man named gustavo fring a businessman hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man and when i tried to quit fring threatened my family i didnt know where to turn eventually hank and fring had a falling out from what i can gather hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business to which fring flatly refused to give him and things escalated fring was able to arrange uh i guess i guess you call it a hit on my brotherinlaw and failed but hank was seriously injured and i wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over upon recovery hank was bent on revenge working with a man named hector salamanca he plotted to kill fring and did so in fact the bomb that he used was built by me and he gave me no option in it i have often contemplated suicide but im a coward i wanted to go to the police but i was frightened hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the albuquerque dea and about that time to keep me in line he took my children from me for months he kept them my wife who up until that point had no idea of my criminal activities was horrified to learn what i had done why hank had taken our children we were scared i was in hell i hated myself for what i had brought upon my family recently i tried once again to quit to end this nightmare and in response he gave me this i cant take this anymore i live in fear every day that hank will kill me or worse hurt my family i all i could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man for what he really is,1

i am a year old father probably one of the oldest people playing this game i am a single father for my son who is now years old my son recently started playing cs in less than a week he has already played more than hours it was terrible for me because it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son because he was always with his friends or watching youtube videos so i decided to create a steam account to play with my son i started playing but it was my first time playing a video game since the s so i was pretty lost i asked my son for help and we spent several hours together playing this game i liked it as it was the best time i have had with my son since my wife died playing video games reminded me that there is fun in everything and it brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside of the house,1
its the best counterstrike game there is period,1

yes,1
counterstrike is a cs game like you would expect from the first game shit now is this game still worth playing when you can just buy the other counterstrike games ae csgo cssource etc well to be honest with you i dont like the cs franchise at all but i think its not worth it even if you do like the franchise this game plays like csgo with shittier graphics and a buggy menu also buying it now wont be worth it since the whole game is about multiplayer and that wont last that long since i dont think people will keep playing this game forever i dont like it maybe you do if you are fan of the cs franchise id pick it up but otherwise i wouldnt,0

h counterstrike the birth of tactical multiplayer shooters h overall rating released in counterstrike quickly became one of the most iconic and influential firstperson shooters in gaming history initially a mod for halflife it revolutionized multiplayer gaming with its emphasis on strategy teamwork and skillbased gameplay even after two decades the games legacy continues to shape competitive shooters gameplay counterstrikes core gameplay centers around two teamsterrorists and counterterroristscompeting in objectivebased rounds whether its planting or defusing bombs or rescuing hostages the game focuses heavily on teamwork and tactical decisionmaking the onelifeperround system adds intensity as each decision carries significant weight unlike many shooters of the time theres no respawning until the round is over raising the stakes for every encounter maps level design the original maps like dedust and deinferno became legendary for their balance and design enabling various playstyles from sniping to closequarters combat the maps were crafted with tactical positioning in mind and players had to learn choke points hiding spots and timing to master them weapons economy the weapon selection was diverse yet balanced offering a range of pistols rifles and grenades the economic system added depth requiring players to spend money wisely between rounds to buy better gear or save for future rounds this resource management became a critical aspect of the games strategy graphics sound given that it was released in the graphics now look dated compared to modern shooters but at the time they were more than adequate the sound design particularly for footsteps and gunfire was crucial for competitive play offering an additional layer of tactical awareness impact legacy counterstrike not only birthed a competitive gaming scene but also laid the foundation for modern esports its simple yet deeply strategic gameplay has spawned numerous sequels spinoffs and millions of devoted fans even in the games influence is felt across every tactical shooter released conclusion counterstrike changed the landscape of multiplayer shooters introducing an unprecedented level of depth and strategy its addictive teambased gameplay and competitive focus have ensured its place in gaming history for those seeking the roots of tactical shooters theres no better place to look than the original counterstrike,1

counterstrikemay or may not be the best online multiplayer fps game ever createduntil loot boxes were invented which is like the equivalent of the stock market crash but in the world of video games of course i would still recommend it to people since its a prime example that you dont need a massive game development team with endless resources and money to create a timeless classic just an idea and a solid community who are dedicated to what they do for the love of the gamealthough im sure having a state of the art dev team a private yacht to code on with a helicopter landing pad and a dedicated fiber internet connection ran under the ocean floor to connect to your of router with a cat ports that support your petabytes per second pbps downloadupload speed and the best attorneys money bitcoin can buy probably doesnt hurt either i miss the days of dropping the files audio sprites skin etc in corresponding cs sub folders for a new weapon skin downloaded from a website from extremely talented individuals as opposed to spending more money on a knife skin than you would on an irl luxury car,1

farewell cs a journey beyond the clock a tale of hours dear counterstrike weve shared countless hoursthe kind that stretch beyond mere gameplay you were my refuge during late nights my adrenaline rush when the world outside faded away we danced through dedust dodged bullets in deinferno and strategized in denuke those pixelated terrorists and counterterrorists became my comrades my rivals my digital family the golden era back in you were my sanctuary the clatter of keyboard keys the rhythmic clicks of the mouseeach sound etched into memory we perfected our bunny hops mastered the art of quickscopes and reveled in the simplicity of your mechanics the thrill of defusing a bomb with seconds to spare or clutching a vit was magic the silence of absence but time moves inexorably forward life pulled me away from the cyber cafes the dimly lit screens responsibilities new games and changing priorities nudged you into the recesses of nostalgia i left you behind like a cherished book on a dusty shelf promising to return someday the reunion cs beckons and return i did cs a phoenix rising from the ashes awaited me the familiar mapsdedust deaztec detrainnow bathed in modern graphics the ak felt weightier the awps scope crisper but the heart of it all remained unchangedthe pulsepounding rounds the camaraderie the thrill of planting or defusing that bomb the unspoken connection cs you whispered secrets to me remember the headshots you said theyre still here and indeed they werethe same rush the same precision my muscle memory stirred as if waking from a long slumber bunny hops oh yes theyre alive and well the revelation as i stepped onto dedust once more the sun setting over the bombsite b i realized cs isnt just a sequel its a bridge across time connecting my past to my present the ghosts of cheered silently acknowledging the torchbearer the bittersweet farewell so dear cs this is my farewell you shaped my gaming soul taught me resilience and gifted me memories but now as i embrace cs i carry you with methe echoes of headshots the adrenaline surges the camaraderie youre not forgotten youre woven into the fabric of my gamer heart to new beginnings and to cs thank you for the seamless transition for honoring the legacy may we continue this journey one headshot at a time farewell old friend the clock ticks but our memories defy its grasp,1

counterstrike a timeless classic that defined an era in the everevolving landscape of gaming few titles stand the test of time like counterstrike released in this firstperson shooter has not only shaped the gaming industry but has also become a cultural phenomenon as i delved back into the realms of counterstrike the nostalgia hit me like a wave reminding me why this game is still revered by gamers around the globe one of the standout features of counterstrike is its simplicity a trait that paradoxically contributes to its enduring appeal the game strips away unnecessary complexities presenting a pure and straightforward multiplayer experience two teams terrorists and counterterrorists face off in a battle of wits and reflexes across various maps its the quintessential formula that has captivated players for over two decades the iconic map design is perhaps one of counterstrike s greatest strengths dust inferno and nuke are not just maps they are virtual battlefields where friendships are forged and rivalries are born each map is meticulously crafted to provide strategic depth ensuring that matches are not just about raw firepower but also about intelligent decisionmaking and teamwork while the graphics may seem outdated by todays standards counterstrike compensates with its unmatched gameplay the weapon mechanics are finely tuned offering a satisfying blend of skill and unpredictability mastering the recoil patterns of each gun becomes an art form and the sound design enhances the immersive experience making every gunshot and footstep crucial in the heat of battle the community aspect is another gem within counterstrike the game thrives on player interaction creating an environment where teamwork and communication are paramount clan matches lan parties and the birth of esports owe much to counterstrike fostering a sense of camaraderie among players that transcends geographical boundaries its worth noting that counterstrike has aged gracefully like a fine wine despite the emergence of newer titles with cuttingedge graphics and advanced features the games core mechanics and balance continue to attract players its simplicity is its strength as it allows for easy accessibility without compromising on the depth that keeps players engaged for hours on end in conclusion counterstrike is more than just a game its a piece of gaming history its enduring legacy speaks volumes about its impact on the industry and the hearts of players who experienced its magic whether youre a veteran revisiting the past or a newcomer curious about gaming history counterstrike is a mustplay that showcases the timeless brilliance of a true classic,1

where it all stated,1
this game is a monarch of tactical shooters and shooters in general though its graphics are outdated it stills holds up many years later many have heard or seen this game due to memes like the infamous door stuck meme which is now a decade and a half old counter strike is a very famous game i like it because of its graphics because i seem too like every single goldscr graphics but the gameplay is sorta bland there isnt no bots and there seems to be a lot of kids playing this one time i heard someone who sounded like a yr old laughing in his or hers mike but eitherway even if i do like how css has bots this game holds up and would be a pick if i had nothing else so yea i believe this game is swell pretty iconic and holds up somewhat well,1

counterstrike remains a cornerstone of the fps genre for good reason and the steam version delivers everything fans have come to expect and more originally launched as a halflife mod in it has since evolved into a global phenomenon and this iteration on steam continues to uphold its legacy the core gameplay mechanics are as tight and exhilarating as ever whether youre a counterterrorist or a terrorist each round is a tense blend of strategy skill and reflexes the emphasis on teamwork and communication is what sets counterstrike apart making every match a thrilling test of coordination and individual prowess graphics and sound while not cuttingedge by todays standards counterstrikes graphics hold up surprisingly well the visual clarity ensures that every movement and shot is easily discernible crucial for a game where splitsecond decisions can mean the difference between victory and defeat the sound design also deserves praise from the iconic weapon noises to the footsteps that keep you constantly on edge one of counterstrikes greatest strengths lies in its dedicated community the games longevity is largely thanks to the passionate player base who continue to innovate with mods maps and game modes with competitive matchmaking casual play and custom servers theres always something new to experience ensuring that even after countless hours the game remains fresh and engaging counterstrike on steam is not just a game its a cultural phenomenon that has stood the test of time whether youre a seasoned veteran or a newcomer its blend of skillbased gameplay strategic depth and enduring community make it a mustplay for anyone interested in competitive shooters few games manage to achieve such a perfect balance of simplicity and complexity making counterstrike a timeless classic that deserves its place in gaming history pros addictive gameplay with a perfect blend of skill and strategy active community with endless customizability and replayability wellmaintained and updated on steam platform cons graphics may feel dated to some players steep learning curve for newcomers unfamiliar with tactical shooters,1

glad i caught your attention the original cs is still a fun game totally worth playing but if youre looking for an authentic server experience sad to say is hard to find one especially with most of the community servers in the game thats mostly hosted by russians and some asian servers that could sometimes put your pc at risk if you could spare a few bucks buy it for your friends too try setting up your own servers together with your own discord community and maybe setup lan play with your friends that is if they brought a laptop or just hit the internet cafe in your area if theres one available plus with the full package it includes condition zero for those who are interested to try out for solo play the og cs doesnt have one since they removed it years ago but cz does have offline bots if youre interested at playing solo,0

counterstrike is a halflife mod where you are put on a team of either terrorists or counterterrorists each team has to work together to achieve a certain objective or eliminate the opposing team whichever happens first the unique feature is that you are given money at the start of each round to buy weapons armor and other useful equipment there are multiple game modes and maps the problem i have with this game is that i bought it twentythree years too late first of all there are no tutorials or instruction booklets that come with this game at least on steam you have to read guides made by other players like i did if you want to know even just the pure basics of gameplay it helps to have experience with other goldsrc the halflife engine games too after you find a server near you that uses your language english language servers in the united states are not as common as you might think youll most likely be stuck playing on the most popular map forever bdedustb a desert map where you either have to deploy a bomb as terrorists or prevent the bomb from being deployed as counterterrorists so if you wanted to play the other game modes or maps good luck on your search anyways if youre a noob to the game like me youre going to be wrecked there are many skills that need to be learned in order to become a decent player these range from the various types of hopping to wallbangs aka shooting players through walls which i am still not sure is fair despite all these struggles for new players the game is still what it needs to be fun its easy to start playing right away and thats one of the benefits to not having a tutorial in just a few clicks youre playing a match with people that have been doing it for over twenty years the servers i played on didnt have terrible people either just the standard fps trash talk youd expect i could play this game for a long time and get better at it but i simply dont care enough to do that my proudest moment getting two frags at the same time hyogis rating b out of picanic basketsbh,1
no bot support,1
this game is responsible for introducing me to fps genre and i love it still fun to play even decades after the release by just playing against bots definitely the game of all time,1
good game where you can play with others in modded servers,1

this game is my goods i give it stars i like that you can crate your owner server,1
only the ogs,1

awful network code everything stutters and hits barely register despite having less than ping the graphics are old and cute but its not worth suffering the awful oldschool netcode play it for a few minutes for nostalgia then delete it interestingly enough cs source provides that perfect cs nostalgia with oldschool graphics and fastpaced deathmatches but it actually has good networking try cs source instead if you have it i got both in a bundle and will never play cs again it was good for its time back in ancient times but today its just painful,0

counterstrike is an amazing game but it definetly feels clunky compared to what we have today if you want to get a better feel for a proper counterstrike experience just buy counter strike source or counter strike classic offensive both of these games are pretty close to cs but fixes the physics and online sync if youre still up to buying power to you,0
im from iraq my dad and uncle set up a lan network gaming shop in our garage during the war in all the kids in the neighborhood used to play counterstrike in our home every single day as shit was hitting the fan outside this was literally our coping mechanism thank you valve,1

definitely worth the time for a nostalgia ride,1
counterstrike wont ever be canceled counterstrike wont be dismantled counterstrike gon na be together counterstrike gon na be forever,1
its counterstrike youll run it well on any computer made in the last years you can find servers playing any game mode you feel like and you dont have to deal with loot boxes what are you going to have to deal with when trying to play it in the present most of the people you play with are going to be hispanic or russian the servers are going to be modded to feature music strange skins parachutes and other weird shit every server is its own community in a way which also means that if you piss off the wrong person youll probably end up banned you know counterstrike gl hf,1

this game is the best thing thats ever happened to me i love this game so much that i would throw my computer out of the window just for it to keep existing this game is so much better than the shitty counterstrike for way too many reasons the performance in this game is so good that even some calculator made in the s can run this game with nearly issues the optimization is good unlike cs where you get frames per a millenium the community is a little toxic but if you find the correct server with the correct year old bulgarian divorced fathers then the game will be a blast for thousands or even hundreds of thousands of hours this game is a blessing from god you need to pay to access heaven for the entirety of your life everything costs nothing here because custom models are completely free and instead of paying for a somewhat good competitive system you can just play fastcup in ik that faceit exists cheating in is way easier than in but mostly no one does it because the community isnt a bunch of retarded german year old spermcells with huge skill issues instead people play the game normally and for fun not for rank this game cures my depression this game cures every single problem in the world that i possibly have this game is the solution to everything the movement is godlike aim system is kinda ass but you just need to learn it and most importantly the gamemodes like kz zm jl are what make this game more peak than peak can ever be those exist in other counter strikes aswell but they cant match cs is superior to its different versions in every single way possible quite literally every single one,1
the true game,1
cs is love cs is life,1
the goat so many memories,1
only types of players maniacs that play this hday for the passed years or absolute newbies that try to aim using the arrows on the keyboard in its an insult to all fps with physics or realism,0
why i cant play with bots there is no option for that i remember that cs had bots to play with,0
good game even after years of playing,1
a great classic easy to learn hard to master the best multiplayer cybersport shooter i have ever played verdict,1

ive never been a fan of cs ive never understood all the mass that are able to move and its admirable moreover as a gameplay point of view doesnt add anything new in my opinion the only positive thing that this game brings is the ability to allow the community to let the imagination flow allowing the users to play football golf or any sport in certain servers which is nice,0
a classic you cant go wrong with,1
very nice game got many memories from the childhood,1
no other game like it you cant replace when you look at the evolution between source go and they all lead into each other in a way you could expect on the other hand its a completely different game no other cs has these wallbangs this movement this shooting and to those that like it you cant get this anywhere else it takes awhile to get into it but once you learn it its so rewarding and fun goldsrc is honestly one of my favorite game engines i personally prefer it over the source engine in many aspects so for me this is one of the best,1

this is objectively the best fps game ever made hands down the movement shooting mechanics still feel crisp after years with some adjustments of course this game is absolutely not noob friendly it really throws you into the deep end the englishspeaking na community is a whole other story its like one big family everyone knows each other best na servers are clan xa socalpugcom nas deathmatch if you are in eu then you also get the option of fastcup which is essentially faceit overall i only have good things to say about this game it can safely be said that this game has been immortalised,1

this was one of the games of my childhood played alot of it in internet cafes the other two where quake and carmagheddon back then it was fun hard to master and a way to make friends after today and many kicks mapsmods downloading server redirection over and over and players appearing out of nowhere just around the corner that was safe i consider this game in its current version a real waste of time and a big disappointment after today i consider counterstrike just a poor mans alternative to csgo both in terms of price and hardware requirements,0

remember the good ol days when internet speed was measured in kilobits and not even your grandma knew what a frag was well step into the time machine and welcome to counterstrike the game that taught us that camping wasnt just for summer vacations back in the day we waited longer for our dialup connection than for a round to start but oh the sweet satisfaction of that headshot after patiently lining up your pixels you could practically hear the thwack of the crt monitor when you hit your mark the graphics were so pixelated youd think the terrorists were trying to plant a bomb made out of minecraft blocks and dont even get me started on the hitboxes they were as wonky as your grandmas antique radio tactical gameplay nah we preferred the spray and pray approach who needs strategy when you can just throw a smoke grenade and rush in with a mac hoping your dialup didnt crash midway remember dedust that iconic map could fit in your pocket now but back then it was our universe we knew every nook cranny and sneaky camping spot like the back of our oversized trackball mice so if youre feeling nostalgic for the days when lan parties were a thing when your mom yelled at you for hogging the phone line and when a headset meant something you wore at an air traffic control tower fire up cs because those were the times when gaming was as simple and chaotic as your favorite family reunion,1

this game is amazing the fact that servers are hosted by someone is really good because cheaters get banned really fast the only thing thats not good is server owners using role plugins that give a huge advantage and cost players real money fair enough because hosting the server costs money,1

i am recommending this because of nostalgia if you are someone who has never played counterstrike i would have a tough time recommending this unless you want to check out where counterstrike got its roots from there are some things in this game that are somewhat anticompetitive like crouch walking some may call it silentstepping groundstrafing gstafing quickswitching to reload faster boosting people through roofs the insane amount of wall bangs you can do some do raise the skill cap where this game shined for me was the modding community and the custom game modes this is where kz started where surfing started where scoutzknivez started bhopping was around before counterstrike but counterstrike had bhop communities as well this is where weapon skins came from as modders would make custom models for weapons and custom player models this and counterstrike condition zero are the only counterstrike games to have a competitive knifing community because the knife mechanics were changed in other versions of counterstrike which made knifing noncompetitive you could get a headshot with a knife how could you not like that the graphics are definitely dated by todays standards and high fps with a high refresh rate monitor does not feel as smooth as in most modern fps games counterstrike has always been one of the best game series for the cost compared to what you get because of the communities and mods that sprung up around it counterstrike does not have a builtin matchmaking ladder like csgo this is the game that really accelerated the esports industry there has been so much esports history made in counterstrike the reason why steam was created in the first place was to give people a more efficient way of updating their games and a way to implement a cheating protection know as valve anticheat with counterstrike being the main focus this game reminds you just how good you had it when you were a kid and not many games can rival the impact counterstrike has had on the esports and gaming industry,1
nostalgic,1
after year this games still worth to play,1

old game very good,1
i have only one word to say memories,1
og counter strike recommend for anyone who is a cs fan and who collects steam games this game fits nice into cs collection,1

if each frame i got per second in this game equaled a dollar id probably have enough money to get a new gaming pc would get an even faster pc again,1

game can be fun depending on what group of sexy boomers you get the cranky unmarried ones get tilted really fast if you are better and start kicking you and banning you from their servers and than the married ones who are funny as heck unfortunately got stuff to do plus theres less of them so overall the servers are a bit unplayable but still the cs i know as i got called tranny and the n word multiple times plus got a few dox and death threats by some older dudes which was kinda hot so hell yeah nothing i would change about this game at all,1
suht sitt,0
hours on csgocs hours on cs source hours on cs so i can say that for a large part of my life i played counter strike games i started playing cs since i was a kid i was playing with bots i didnt even have speakers but i still had so much fun no matter how much nerves this game made me i always came back to it i love the counter strike series and always will counter strike was my childhood alongside other games like gta i also really like counter strike but valve please kindly make a better anti cheat for this game its a shame for the community its a shame for the whole history of this name to be ruined by hackers,1
always been amazing,1
ii,1
i started playing cs in elementary school and it has been more than ten years now although its history is not worth mentioning i just want to say that this classic game will never be passed down i have watched countless games and the most impressive one is the ukrainian sniper god markeloff now his successor is simple neo and frest the two great gods have always been mutually exclusive thinking about that era now is truly memorable,1

amazing fps game really good for if you have an ancient pc and somehow have steam running but for modern pcs this does require some tinkering in the games console to run stable because its made for older hardware in mind,1
engine is fked not counterstrike anymore just some game with cs maps and a poor facsimile of the mechanics,0

hwhat makes this game specialh urlhttpsteamcommunitycomidkylejameskey to the reviewurl bsb great game to start a great franchise bpb plays like halflife and has poor mechanics and sounds beb can not endure the game anymore with its outdated engine and graphics bcb frustrating game with professional community to destroy new players bib not much thinking involved pretty mindless bab play time varies based on peoples standards blb mostly skill with very little luck involved in this game horiginal reviewh hello fellow soldiers this is easily a game that i have not played all that much it was a great game for when it came out and its a lot of fun for what it is overall the graphics and hitboxes are very poor and im not going to recommend this game overall i got this game in the valve complete pack and i tried it because it was the first game that would spark the legendary counterstrike series for the time it was great now id recommend either getting counterstrike global offensive or counterstrike source im not going to recommend this game because there are newer and better versions of it out kyle james,0

i cant find a normal server the game is pretty good if you can get some people to play,0
a classic,1
yes,1
considering that there is a far more superior product today there is no reason to play this apart from nostalgia reasons still i bought this to play some classic maps like the original assault which has been utterly destroyed by csgo in my opinion poolday and iceworld unfortunately alongside low playercount it is hard to find a server to my liking a server that plays older classic maps rather than modded and frankly shittier variants of the originals it has been a waste buying this in my own unique situation but it doesnt mean that you cant satisfy your desire for nostalgia,0

this game has deeper meaning than what we usually feel without this game there is a void of happiness in the steam library of any player you can never be wrong with this game even if you play it more than cs go no doubt this game deserves a padmabhushan award for what it has achieved a true paradise for real fps gamer l classico type environment in wars daily valve must be unicorn company looking at success of this game,1
